            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Hee wrote other letters of the ſame effect vnto the Cardinall, promiſing him by word of mouth, to certifie him of certaine things of great importance, which as then hee durſt not write: and to conclude, hee promiſed him the meanes, to giue him intelligence, how and in what ſort hee ſhould deuiſe and frame proces againſt the greateſt Lords of the Realme.

On the other ſide, the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> complained to the Queene-mother, touching the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> that was preferred both before himſelfe and the Conſtable, and proceeded ſo farre therein, that both he, and the reſt of the Princes of the blood, with the Conſtable and diuers Noblemen,<note place="margin">The Queen-mother aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency.</note> began to prepare themſelues to depart out of the Court: but ſhe perceiued that to be a blowe wherewith to abate her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, by the Cardinall of <hi>Tournons</hi> meanes, ſhee ſent for the Conſtable, commanding him expreſly from the King, that he ſhould not depart from the Court.

               <p>The Miniſters aduertiſed of this reſolution, contrary vnto all Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call conference, by requeſt made their complaint vnto the King, which being preſented to the Chancellor,<note place="margin">A new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of the Cardinall to diſgrace the Miniſters.</note> hee according to his wiſedome prouided for it in ſuch ſort, that the Prelates proceeded in another manner.

<hi>Trent,</hi> that did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing therein, becauſe their Church cannot erre. At the ſame time certaine let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were diſcouered, written in the Kings name vnto his Ambaſſador in <hi>Rome,</hi> named <hi>Monſieurde l'Iſle,</hi> &amp; others from the Queen-mother, which ſhewed that al their conference was but a deuiſe, and meere inuention, thereby to intrappe the Cleargie, which agreed vnto ſome Tithes, to ſaue the reſt of their ſtakes:<note place="margin">The intent of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at Poiſsy.

               <p>They went from thence about the end of Nouember, and at the time of their departure, there roſe a moſt horrible &amp; extraordinary wind: aforeſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as ſome affirmed) of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peſt that not long after enſued.

Hee caſt the Miniſters in priſon, rebaptiſed the children, reitzerated marriages, draue out ſuch as pleaſed him, and cleanſed their houſes of all that could bee found therein.

<hi>le Dangereux,</hi> were hanged. A <hi>Bourguignon,</hi> named
<hi>Monſieur de Trouan,</hi> that came into <hi>France</hi> to fiſh in troubled waters as others did, thought to playe the warriour, and to aſſayle <hi>Antraine,</hi> but hauing loſt part of his men, hee retired with ſhame: and not content therewith, ſeeking to reuenge himſelfe, was ſlaine by <hi>Blanay</hi> in a certaine encounter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monſieur d'Iſſertieux,</hi> called by thoſe of

                  <hi>Cheuenon, Achon,</hi> and others, did what they could to enter therein, but they were alwaies driuen away: but in the end, <hi>la Fayette</hi> beſieged it, hauing the great Prior of <hi>Auuergne</hi> for his Lieftenant, &amp; by means of a diuiſion that happened among the Inhabitants, the Towne was yeelded by compoſition, with ſufficient aduantage for thoſe of the religion: but the firſt thing that the great Prior did, was to take <hi>Iſſertieux</hi> by the boſome, from whom was pulled the counterpaine of the agreement: his armour, and one of his horſes. Which was done vpon the 10. of Iune. Certain daies &amp; months enſuing, thoſe of the religion were pilled and ranſacked, in ſo many and diuers kindes, by <hi>la Fayette,</hi> that they were notable to paye any more: to whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was either too hotte, or too heauie, as alſo by his company, the Liefte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and certaine Councellours of Saint <hi>Pierre le Monſtier,</hi> tooke their partes <pb n="127" facs="tcp:22081:64"/>likewiſe. In the moneth of February, 1563. the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſent three com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Lanciers thither to refreſh them: but thoſe of the Towne, and the theeues themſelues, doubting to be pilled, ſhutte the Gates, which put the Lanciers in great furie: who to reuenge themſelues, vſed great cruelties about the Towne, on that ſide that bordereth vppon <hi>Berry,</hi> againſt thoſe of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, drawing ſome of them at their horſes tailes.</p>
               <p>The third of March, Captaine <hi>Boys, Bloſſet,</hi> and
<hi>Blanay,</hi> ſcaled and tooke <hi>la Charite,</hi> which the three companions aforeſaid ſoght to relieue, but they were conſtrained to retire. Within three daies after, Captaine <hi>Boys</hi> ſtaying therein, onely with ſixtie ſeuen ſouidiers, kept the Towne againſt an armie of three or four thouſand men, both horſe and foote, and fixe field peeces, where he ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained the ſiege eight daies togither, without loſſe of any man, hauing ſlaine aboue foureſcore of the aſſaylants, conſtrained the reſt to leaue the ſiege, to their no ſmal confuſion: in ſuch ſort, that by the edict of pacification, the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the religion remained within <hi>la Charite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many ſmall Townes in thoſe quarters were much moleſted, ſpecially in reſpect: of the religion: as <hi>Bony, Coſne, Neufui,</hi> and others:<note place="margin">Chaſtillon Sur Loire.</note> but moſt of all

               <p>In the month of February, <hi>Monterud</hi> Gouernour of

The Towne beeing pilled and ſpoyled of all whatſoeuer it had, euen to the boltes, lockes, barres and glaſſe-windowes of the houſes, which notwithſtanding, aſſoone as <hi>Manteruds</hi> armie was departed, thoſe of the religion that had eſcaped, returned thither againe, and reeſtabliſhed the exerciſe of religion.</p>

Not long before they had vſed all the meanes they could (by counſell of ſome Traitors) to bring certain troupes of ſouldiers into the towne to maſſacre the people,<note place="margin">Monlius in Bourbonois.</note> but their enterpriſe tooke no effect. <hi>Monſieur de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare</hi> being come to <hi>Moulius</hi> in <hi>Bourbonnois,</hi> with commiſsion, therein to vſe all hard and extreame dealing towards thoſe of the religion: firſt, without any forme of lawe or proceſſe, hee cauſed two Artificers to be hanged, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing himſelfe to be ſtrong of men, draue all ſuch as hee any thing doubted out of the Towne: which done, hee gaue his troupes leaue to iſſue foorth, and to ſlay all thoſe that by any means were found in the fields, vſing al kind of ſtrange dealings and extremities, vnto the houſes and farmes lying about it.

Not long before the peace, they beheaded one called <hi>Rolandiere:</hi> hung a Ioyner, and maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred foure others by moone-light, and beeing halfe dead, threw them into the riuer. In the Villages both farre and neare vnto it, many murthers both of men, women, and children, were committed, to the number of ſixe ſcore and vpwards, with particular cruelties, and ſuch horrible traiterous meanes, that I am abaſhed to remember, and aſhamed to recite them. One named Captaine

But about the 22. of the ſame moneth, a Gentleman comming thither to demaund ayde of men, and money for the Prince, certaine ſouldiers that bare him company, in the night time brake down the Images in Saint <hi>Sanſons</hi> Church: which moued the Prieſts, although the Gentleman, much condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their action, and had not any part of the ſpoyle.

The next day their began a horrible tumult, for that vnder pretence of diſarming thoſe of the religion, they entered into their houſes, and becauſe two of them among the reſt, whereof one was the receiuer of the talages, had ſhune their Gates, their enemies tooke occaſion to ring a bell, wherevppon preſently thoſe two houſes were robbed and ſpoyled, ſome of the ſeruants ſlaine, the reſt priſoners: the kings mony taken and made priſe, partly by
<hi>Puygallard</hi> and his companions. Which done, they caſt both men and women of the religion, and of all ſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to priſon. In a Marchants houſe they found diuers bookes of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which were burnt openly in the middle of the Towne: and the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the Monke <hi>Richelieu</hi> hauing found a guilded Bible, ſtickt it vpon a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bord, and iſſuing from thence, went in proceſsion through all the greateſt ſtreetes, and ſinging like Prieſtes, ſaid: Behold trueth hanged, the trueth of the Huguenots, the trueth of all the diuelles: behold the mightie God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the euerlaſting God will ſpeake.

               <p>Within diuers daies after, and till the end of that yeare, to the number of eightie perſons were executed and put to death.

               <p>Seuen daies after, the Cittizens muſtered themſelues, and the Court of Parliament withdrew it ſelfe, yet without any cauſe. Meane time, <hi>Villebon</hi>

<hi>Montgommerie</hi> perceiuing no remedie, entered into a Galley, and with ſuch as coulde ſaue themſelues therein, went to <hi>New-Hauen:</hi> others that ſought to do the like without boates, were drowned: ſuch as fledde out at the gates were ſpoyled and robbed of all they had, and ſome taken priſoners. Diuers Miniſters beeing within a ſtrong Tower, yeelded themſelues vpon promiſe of ſafetie: but contrary to promiſe, they were kept priſoners, yet eſcaped onely <hi>Marolart,</hi> and preſident
<hi>Maudreuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi> an excellent man, that were betrayed by one S.
<hi>Estene,</hi> that had promiſed to ſaue them, and for his paines, he ſhould haue had 2000. Crownes. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable threatned <hi>Marolart,</hi> but he indured it patiently: many Engliſh and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſouldiers were hanged, the reſt being ſicke, taken and caſt into the riuer of <hi>Siene. Maudreuille, Monſieur de Soquence,</hi> and <hi>Berthonuille,</hi> Councellors of the Towne, with <hi>Marolart,</hi> were condemned to die:
<hi>Maudreuille,</hi> to looſe his head,<note place="margin">Diuers nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſons executed.</note> the reſt to be hanged, which was preſently executed with many opprobrious ſpeeches, againſt <hi>Marolart,</hi> both by the Conſtable and his ſonne. They all dyed conſtantly in the profeſſion of the Goſpell. The next day, 5. Captaines and two others were likewiſe executed. The ſpoyle and ſacking of the Towne, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued aboue
4. moneths togither, and it is almoſt incredible to ſpeake, what great riches was taken and borne out of the Towne: ſuch as came from <hi>Parris, Amiens, Beauuais,</hi> and other, places to buy the ſpoiles, in theyr returnes home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, were eyther robbed of all they hadde, or elſe neuer proſpered in theyr affaires.</p>
               <p>Touching <hi>Deepe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deepe.</note> thoſe of the religion therein maintained themſelues ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, exerciſing many notable exployts againſt thoſe that ſought to moleſt them. So that from the beginning of May, vntill October, their enemies loſt <pb n="138" facs="tcp:22081:70"/>to the number of one thouſand or twelue hundreth men. This Towne ſerued for a retrait to great numbers of the religion, from diuers places, nouriſhed an infinit number of poore people, ayded thoſe of <hi>Roane</hi> with all the meanes they could, but the ſuccors they ſent to help the town, being cut off &amp; ouerthrown, the Towne of <hi>Deep</hi> perceiuing it ſelfe not able to reſiſt, in fine, by many threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, promiſes and other meanes, they yeelded the Towne vppon certaine conditions: the woorſt whereof was, that the exerciſe of religion was taken from them: the Marſhall <hi>de Montmorancy</hi> eſtabliſhing <hi>Ricaruille</hi> and
<hi>de Baque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uille,</hi> with foure hundreth men to commaund therein: yet thoſe of the religion loſt not courage, but made ſuch ſute vnto the Queen-mother, (that feared the Admirall and the ſiege of <hi>Orleans</hi>) that they obtained licence to aſſemble in ſmal companies, which they did, hauing certain Miniſters that eſcaped from <hi>Roane:</hi> yet there was not one Prieſt in all the countrie, that durſt once venture to ſaye Maſſe within <hi>Deep,</hi> &amp; although the two Captains aforeſaid, kept good watch, yet they were ſurpriſed: for the twentieth of December,
<hi>Monſieur Ricaruille</hi> beeing gone out of the Caſtle with one of his ſeruants, to ſee his horſes, in a ſtable not farre from it, was ſlaine by <hi>Monſieur de Chaſtiuille,</hi> and Captaine
<hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> who preſently ceaſed vpon the Caſtle,<note place="margin">Deep taken from thoſe of the Romiſh Church.</note> and hauing intelligence with thoſe that were in it, armed themſelues and entered into the Towne, where with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hurting any man, they tooke <hi>Baqueuille,</hi> whom all men had forſaken: that done, the exerciſe of the religion was againe publikely permitted, and the Gouernment of the Towne, giuen to <hi>Monſieur de la Curee,</hi> a Gentleman well affected to the religion.</p>
               <p>There happened diuers exploytes of warre in many places of
<hi>Normandy,</hi> becauſe of the Townes, but becauſe the moſt part of them were but ſurpriſes, and ordinarie ſtratagems, we will not ſpeake of them, but onely of that which ſeemeth woorthieſt memorie.</p>
               <p>The ſeuenth of Iune 1562. <hi>Meſsieurs de Houeſuille,</hi> and <hi>de Cequeuille, Gilles Michant</hi> Phiſitian,<note place="margin">Valongnes.</note> 
                  <hi>Iohn Guifart,</hi> and <hi>Robert de Verdun</hi> Counnellours, were maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred in <hi>Valongues</hi> for religion, and the houſes of ſuch as made profeſsion, were filled with ſouldiers, that did what they liſt therein, for the ſpace of eight daies.</p>
               <p>In the Moneth of May,<note place="margin">Vire.</note> before
<hi>Viere</hi> hauing been taken by <hi>Montgommery,</hi> the Images beaten downe, and the Reliques borne away, the religion reeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, vpon the laſt of Iuly, thoſe of the Romiſh Church aſſayled thoſe of the religion, as they came out from the ſermon, whereof they ſlewe three men, whereof one was ſtoned by the women, beeing in the riuer, and hurt diuers. But about the end of Auguſt, they were reuenged thereof by meanes of
<hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Montgommery,</hi> that ſent them ayde, which did much miſchiefe to all the countrie round about: but not long after, againe the Duke <hi>d'Eſtampes</hi> tooke the Towne by force, and many of them put vnto the ſword.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>d'Eſtampes</hi> hauing gotten <hi>Vire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Saint Lo.</note> went to Saint <hi>Lo,</hi> where hauing continued ſiege for the ſpace of fiue or ſixe daies, in the end hee tooke it, the Towne beeing ſacked and put to the ſpoyle.<note place="margin">Nowhauen.</note> 
                  <hi>New-Hauen,</hi> a Towne of great importance, hauing beene brauely deliuered vnto the Prince, by <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame de Chartres, Monſieur de Beauuoir,</hi> and <hi>la Nocle</hi> his brother in lawe:
<hi>Vidame</hi> going into England, meaning not to leaue the place vnprouided, let the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping thereof to one named <hi>Roquebrune,</hi> to whom hee gaue commiſsion to <pb n="139" facs="tcp:22081:70"/>raiſe three hundreth men for the guard therof. He preſently went vnto the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> and after to the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> promiſing to deliuer <hi>New-Hauen</hi> vnto them, and proceeded therewith, vntill ſuch time as he ſhould haue executed his charge. But the enterpriſe being diſcouered to <hi>Monſieur de Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noir,</hi> he tooke ſpeedie order for the reliefe thereof, cauſing
<hi>Roquebrune</hi> to looſe his head. Meane time, <hi>Vidame</hi> dealt with the Queene of <hi>England,</hi> to aide thoſe of the religion, vpon condition, that for the ſecuritie and ſafegard of her men, ſhe ſhould haue the Towne of <hi>New-Hauen</hi> deliuered vnto her, without any preiudice vnto the King or to the Realme: whervpon 6000. Engliſh men were ſent into
<hi>Normandie:</hi> whereof part were in <hi>Roane,</hi> where they fought valiantly till the laſt man: and if they had bene ſeconded, the iſſue thereof would haue fallen out otherwiſe. Some were put into <hi>Deepe,</hi> the greateſt part ſtaying in <hi>New-Hauen,</hi> vnder the conduct of the Earle of <hi>VVarwicke. Roan</hi> being taken, the <hi>Ringraue</hi> came before <hi>New-Hauen:</hi> where the Engliſh men and Scots gaue him many a ſkirmiſh. Many meanes were ſought to corrupt <hi>Monſier de Beauuoir,</hi> with promiſes of fiftie thouſand crownes, a coller of the order, and a company of Lanciers: But by no meanes he would conſent to yeeld the Towne, nor yet in any ſort blemiſh his honour.</p>
               <p>Touching <hi>Britaigne,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Eſtampes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Britaine.</note> a Gentleman of good and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate nature, behaued himſelfe very indifferently with thoſe of the religion, as long as the Queene-mother ſeemed to hang in ſuſpence. But warres once kindled, and his Nephew <hi>Sebastian de Luxembourg,</hi> a cruell man, if euer there were any in <hi>France,</hi> being ioyned with him for aſſiſtant, mutenous companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s began to ſtirre, in ſuch ſort, that thoſe of the Army of <hi>Triumuirat,</hi> ſeemed to ſette one vpon the other. But yet thoſe of the religion made good meanes to helpe themſelues.</p>
               <p>Nowe lette vs ſee what happened vnto the country of
<hi>Guyene,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Guyenne</note> during theſe firſt troubles. The firſt of Aprill, 1562. <hi>Monluc</hi> cauſed the towne of
<hi>Fumel</hi> to bee vnwalled: Threw downe certaine houſes, and ſette them at a fine of three hundreth thouſand frankes: to bee payde vnto the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe and Orphanes, of <hi>Monſieur de Fumel,</hi> not long before murthered by thoſe of the Towne.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of the religion foreſeeing the miſchiefes that
<hi>Monluc</hi> wold worke, if he were not preuented, deſired <hi>Monſieur de Duras</hi> to ſtay in the Prouince, where hee fonud great forces, but hee excuſed himſelfe by the commandement giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him from the Prince, to lead certaine forces to <hi>Orleans,</hi> which was the means of moſt great miſeries, and cruell maſſacres that happened in that countrie. Thoſe of the religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> hauing let ſlip the means to get the Towne peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably into their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, while <hi>Burie</hi> &amp; <hi>Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>luc</hi> were abſent, that went about to erect their ſnares, and to aſſure themſelues, they could no more attaine vnto it, for that minding to aſſaye it once againe, they found ſo many faint hearted peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple emong them, that they were conſtrained to ſaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in <hi>Duras:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Parliament being informed, cauſed their houſes to be ſpoiled &amp; thrown downe: threatning all ſuch as they could lay hands vpon: and among the reſt, two Miniſters named <hi>Neufchaſtle</hi> and
<hi>Grene.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monluc</hi> had his greateſt quarrell againſt thoſe of
<hi>Agen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Agen.</note> who among diuers other enterpriſes of that Towne, had ſurely been taken and ſpoyled by them, had it not beene for the improuidence of <hi>Monſieur de Memy,</hi> Generall for the <pb n="140" facs="tcp:22081:71"/>warres for thoſe of the religion, in
<hi>Guyenne</hi> and all the countrie adioyning, wherein hee behaued himſelfe with no great honour, as beeing a man rather addicted to his ſtudie, then vnto armes, which in the end made him looſe his head vppon a Scaffold.
<hi>Burie</hi> and <hi>Monluc,</hi> knowing with whom they had to deale, ſought diuers meanes to intrappe thoſe of <hi>Argen:</hi> and to the ſame end, cauſed Captaine <hi>Charry</hi> to lye about the Towne: but an Ambaſcado, being ſet for him, hee was put to flight, leauing 45. of his men dead vpon the ground, and fifteene priſoners. <hi>Memy</hi> brought great forces into <hi>Agen,</hi> but knowing not how to imploye them, hee was forſaken by <hi>Arpaion</hi> and <hi>Marchaſtel:</hi> who as then (if hee would haue credited them) could haue ouerthrowne <hi>Monluc:</hi> who knowing his aduerſaries weake conduction, neuer ceaſed to giue him diuers alarmes. About the end of three weekes, <hi>Memies</hi> troupes hauing done no good in
<hi>Agen,</hi> departed and left their companies. To the contrary,
<hi>Monluc</hi> ceaſed not to make diuers courſes into the countrie, conſtraining them to ſupply his want of victuals and munition, his ſouldiers running to the gates of <hi>Agen:</hi> and mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with any of the religion, they put a halter about his necke, and if hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued conſtant, they put him to cruell death, or elſe ranſomed, and then killed him. And ſuch as were but weake of faith, after they had made them trot with them, they conſtrained them to make the ſigne of the croſſe, to ſay an
<hi>Aue Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> and to conſeſſe and acknowledge the Maſſe to bee good: yet they were not content there with, but forced them to ſweare and blaſpheme God, at the leaſt fiue or ſixe times togither: which done, they were accounted and holden for good and ſufficient Catholikes in
<hi>Monluc</hi> and <hi>Peyrot</hi> his ſonnes opinions. The ſeuenth of Auguſt, thoſe of <hi>Agen</hi> repulſed Captaine <hi>Bourg,</hi> that kept a paſſage from them full of good prouiſion: but hauing gotten the place, their ſouldiers buſied themſelues about harkening after the ſweet wines: ſo that the next day againe, <hi>du Rourg</hi> ſurpriſed and ſlewe ſixtie of them, diſpearſing the reſt: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of diuers paſsing the riuer, dranke more water, then the day before they had ſwallowed wine. But the next day inſuing, they had their reuenge at
<hi>Lerac,</hi> where by certaine intelligence, they ſlew eightie of
<hi>Monlucs</hi> ſouldiers: which notwithſtanding within 4. daies after, thoſe of <hi>Agen</hi> perceiuing their towne to be weake, iſſued out of the Towne all armed, to the number of ſixe hundreth men: deliuering the keyes vnto the Conſulles, deſiring them not to forget the great courteſie ſhewed vnto them by thoſe of the religion, when they were Maiſters of the Towne. Women of good account bare their children in their armes, in a cradle vppon their heads, or elſe carried them on their ſhoulders. And in that ſort hauing trauelled all night, they found themſelues to bee about ſeuen great leagues from <hi>Agen:</hi> where they ſtayed for <hi>Duras,</hi> that prouided for their ſecuritie.</p>
               <p>The next day, thoſe of <hi>Agen</hi> ſought to kill and maſſacre ſuch as they could intrappe. <hi>Burie</hi> and <hi>Monluc</hi> preſently came thither, and after all the mooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables had been ceaſed vpon, and borne away, they ceaſed vpon the immcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, executing diuers priſoners: puniſhing thoſe that were abſent by their pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clieres, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fiſcating their goods, as it pleaſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to appoint. Without the town nothing was heard, but onely of horrible and cruell murthers, and that in the
<hi>Bourg</hi> of the paſſage, there were two young children roſted.
<hi>Duras</hi> hearing of thoſe great miſchiefes, marched towards
<hi>Lauſerte,</hi> a Towne in <hi>Quercy:</hi> which vppon the fifteenth of Auguſt, he tooke by force: beeing conſtrained there vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:22081:71"/>by the braueries of thoſe that were within it: in the Town he ſlew 567. me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, among which, were 9. ſcore and 14. Prieſts. Part of thoſe of <hi>Agen</hi> were within the caſtle of <hi>Roime,</hi> that
<hi>Duras</hi> had committed vnto the charge of Captain <hi>Lyou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> where <hi>Monluc</hi> beſieged them, battering the place 3. daies togither. They within, ſuſtaining a furious aſſault: but in the ende, the number of ſouldiers that were therein being but ſmall, and <hi>Lyouran</hi> being ſlaine, the Caſtle was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. <hi>Monluc</hi> hauing loſt about ſeauen hundreth men, the crueltie he vſed was extreame, not ſparing old nor young, killing young children in their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers armes, and then the mothers. They reſerued certaine women, whereof <hi>Burie</hi> would haue 2. for his part. <hi>Monluc</hi> behauing himſelfe in ſuch fort, that I abhorre to write it.</p>
               <p>This happened to thoſe of <hi>Agen,</hi> but that was not all: For after the ouerthrowe of the Army of <hi>Duras,</hi> diuers of thoſe that eſcaped, hauing bene taken, were brought to <hi>Agen,</hi> a place appointed for the butchery, where they had erected a gybbit, called the conſiſtory: in ſuch ſort, that from the time that thoſe of the religion left the Towne, vntill the Edict of peace, there were abone fiue hundreth men executed to death: and the Participants of <hi>Monluc,</hi> to fil vp their iniquities, baniſhed the women and children out of the Towne: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whom, they ſent the ſouldiers: hanged a Counſellor in his long gowne and ſquare Cap. Not long before this ouerthrowe of <hi>Duras, Memy</hi> forſaken of all men, thinking to withdraw himſelfe into <hi>Bearn,</hi> was taken priſoner, and led to <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> Where by ſentence in Court of Parliament, he had his head ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Exployts of Monſieur de Duras, tell his ouerthrow</note>We muſt now ſpeake a word of the exployts done by
<hi>Monſieur de Duras</hi> in <hi>Guyenne,</hi> vntill his ourthrowe. Hee hauing receiued charge to raiſe all the forces he could to ayde the Prince, and to march towards <hi>Orleans,</hi> his intents were often times croſſed by diuers meanes: and hauing begunne to rayſe certaine forces, hee was put in minde, that he might bee a good meanes with them to aſſure
<hi>Bourdeaux:</hi> Which taking no effect, hee determined to ſeiſe vppon the Countrey betweene the two Seas, ſituate betvveene <hi>Gerome,</hi> and
<hi>Dordongne,</hi> there to gather his forces. But approching neere Saint
<hi>Machaire,</hi> in ſtead of victualls, they ſhot diuers Muſkettes at him, whereby ſome of his men were ſlaine: which cauſed him to aſſayle and force the Towne: yet much ſupported by the greate humanitie of
<hi>Duras,</hi> whome <hi>Burie</hi> and <hi>Monluc</hi> then determined to inuade: aſſuring themſelues, that hauing diſperſed his forces, they ſhoulde eaſilye accompliſhe theyr owne deſires through out all
<hi>Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which being concluded, they ouertooke him hard by

<hi>Duras</hi> a charge, who recouering a litle wood full of Diches, behaued himſelfe ſo well with three hundreth pikes, the reſt of his troupes hauing forſaken him, that hee conſtrained <hi>Monluc</hi> to retire with the loſſe of three hundreth men, and <hi>Duras</hi> about thirtie or more. After that, hee determined to leaue off his enterpriſe, hauing the conduction of many meane ſouldiers, and men wholely enemies to diſcipline: yet hauing pittie of the Country, and hoping that his Souldiers woulde doo better, hee reaſſembled them. Procuring others, <pb n="142" facs="tcp:22081:72"/>marched towards
<hi>Agenois</hi> and <hi>Quercy,</hi> ayding them of <hi>Agen</hi> as much as poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he might. But hauing heard what happened therein, after the departure of thoſe of the religion, hee puniſhed thoſe of

               <p>To the ſame end <hi>du Bordet,</hi> a valiant Gentleman, with

<hi>Du Bordet</hi> entered <hi>Pons,</hi> forced S. <hi>Satier,</hi> wherin were ſlain twelue Prieſts, then entered into <hi>la Linde,</hi> a Towne in

<hi>Duras</hi> and <hi>Marchaſtel,</hi> hee determined to punniſh thoſe of <hi>Sarlat,</hi> that had ſlaine two Gentlemen, and paſsing by
<hi>Cauſſade,</hi> to go to <hi>Montau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> to fetch Artillerie, and to raiſe more ſouldiers, certaine Prieſts that did much miſchiefe, were ſet vpon and forced within a ſteeple, and caſt headlong out of it vppon the ground: and ſome others of the principall of the Towne, authors of the maſſacre committed in that place vpon thoſe of the religion, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto the Marſhall of <hi>Guyenne,</hi> were executed to death: they placed good Garriſon in <hi>Realuille,</hi> and marching to

<hi>Monluc</hi> perceiuing that <hi>Duras</hi> began to retire, made haſte to ouertake him, and gaue him a charge, where in a maner no reſiſtance was made, whereby they entred ſo farre into <hi>Duras</hi> Campe, that they ſeized vpon the artillery and their carriages, and there the ſoldiers ſtaying, greedier of praye then of honour, gaue ſuch as had firſt fled to reaſſemble, and ſo to paſſe the water, throwing downe their arms to flye the eaſitier: the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw was of about fiue or ſixe hundreth ſoldiers, and 2500. boyes and pages, with all the artilerie, ſome of thoſe that were taken priſoners being hanged, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Miniſters: who by the aduiſe of the Church, had followed thoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies. I will recite one particularly. Among the priſoners, there was a Captain called
<hi>la Mothe,</hi> that fell to Captaine <hi>Bazourdans</hi> lot. Who not long after mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with <hi>Monluc,</hi> hee gaue him diuers ſtabbes with a dagger, and thruſt him through with his rapier, ſaying theſe words.

                  <hi>Duras</hi> hauing aſſembled thoſe that paſt the riuer, and made two retraits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aduertiſed that Captaine
<hi>Laumoſniere,</hi> ſent by <hi>Monſierde Sanſac,</hi> ſtayed for him at <hi>Embornet</hi> with fiue hundreth men, to make an end of an ouerthrow, not being once abaſhed, marched right vnto the place, where hearriued about the breake of day: and behaued himſelfe ſo well, that
<hi>Laumoſniere</hi> and all his men, onely three that bare the newes to

               <p>The 10. of March 1562. <hi>Mont de Marſan</hi> was taken by certaine of <hi>Monlucs</hi> forces: thoſe of the religion after many outrages,<note place="margin">Mont de Marſan.</note> being conſtrained to flie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome other place, and to leaue both wines and children. Not long after, ſixe of the principall of them, being kept priſoners, had their heads ſtriken off, and three or foure others executed in diuers manners. And a Lancier bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken after the peace of <hi>Villeneufue de Marſan,</hi> was buried quicke: and at <hi>Caſeras</hi> in the moneth of Auguſt, a young woman named <hi>Ieanne de la Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> purſued to bee violated, threw her ſelfe out of a Windowe, and dyed thereof.</p>
               <p>The Hyſtorie of <hi>Thoulouſe</hi> and other places belonging to the Parliament of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> is very long: but I wil aſſay to make a breefe rehearſall thereof,<note place="margin">Thoulouſe.</note> as of the reſt. The Edict of Ianuarie hauing beene publiſhed therein, things were peaceablye handled vntill the ſecond of Aprill, when by an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of a Buriall, thoſe of the Romiſhe Church, in the Subburbes of Sainct <hi>Michael,</hi> Sainct <hi>Steuen,</hi> and Sainct <hi>Saluador</hi> in <hi>Thoulouſe,</hi> aſſayled thoſe of the Religion, and hurt greate numbers of them: Killing foure outright, beſides diuers more of them that were throwne downe into a well.</p>
               <p>The Parliament fauoured this action: but to the contrary, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitalles ſought by all meanes to repreſſe the ſedition, and layde holde vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſome of the chiefe dealers therein: but the tumult ſtill increaſed, and ſo continued vntill night, both within and without the Towne. The next day nothing was done, but faire words to appeaſe ſo great an iniurie: neuertheleſſe, <pb n="144" facs="tcp:22081:73"/>the Capitalles purſued the matter ſo well, that foure of the ſeditious perſons were hanged, and two whipt. But the fyer of deuiſion began to bee ſo houe, that thoſe of the religion alreadie threatned with that which after enſued, ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed vpon the Town-houſe, and certain corners of the ſtreetes: which mooued the Parliament in ſuch maner, that preſently they ſent for al the gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts to be their aydes, calling the commons to gither, cauſing it to bee publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed throughout the Towne, that all men ſhould take weapon in hands to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade thoſe of the religion, who by the intermiſſion of the Capitalles, aſſayed to appeaſe that Tumult. <hi>Monluc</hi> gaue the wheele good paſſage, by writing to the Parliament, that the Capital <hi>de Lanta,</hi> new come from the Court lying without the Towne, had promiſed the Prince, to cauſe the Towne to hold for him.</p>
               <p>The thirteenth of May, the Preſidents and Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cellors comming forth in their Scarlet gownes, cauſed it to be cryed throughout the Towne, and in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, that all good Catholicques, and faithfull ſeruants to the King, ſhould take armes and vſe them againſt thoſe of the religion: to take them eyther dead or liuing, and to kill and ſpoyle them of all they haue without all mercie. Beſides that, fiue or ſix Councellors went crying throughout the Towne, that they ſhould not ſpare to kill and ſpoyle: being liſenced thereunto by the Court, with permiſſion both from Pope and the King. The coppie of this proclamation, was preſently ſent to all the Borrowes and Villages round about: wherewith belles began to be rung in all the ſteeples of the Towne, and preſently after in all the Countrey round about, for foure or fiue Leagues compaſſe. <hi>Thoulonſe</hi> is one of the greateſt and moſt populos Townes in all <hi>France.</hi> At which time, there was within it, at the leaſt 25. or thirtie thouſand perſons of the religion, and of diuers qualities &amp; ages:<note place="margin">Horrible Maſſacre in Thoulouſe.</note> and then began one of the moſt horrible maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries that can be remembred. The priſons were preſently filled, and many were knocked on the head, at the entry into it, becauſe it would hold no more. The riuer in ſhort ſpace was couered with dead bodies, &amp; many were throwne out of windowes into the riuer, from whence if they ſeemed to eſcape, they were preſently ſlaine with ſwordes and ſtones.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of the religion that had ſtrengthned them within the Town-houſe, and in certain other places, defended themſelues with great courage, and made diuers ſallies, and if treaſon hadde not beene wrought againſt them by Captaine <hi>Saulx,</hi> they had gotten the Pallace, and driuen their enemies out of the Towne, but he put them from that: whereof preſently enſued a totall ruine. For the next day beeing the fourteenth, thoſe of the religion perceiuing that of force they muſt die, reſolued to defend themſelues, and beſides the peeces that they hadde within the Towne-houſe, wherewith they abaſhed their enemies, they iſſued diuers times out of their fortes, to ſkirmiſh with the enemie, where betweene them much blood was ſpilt.<note place="margin">The Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens fight.</note> The ſame day <hi>Bellegarde</hi> Lief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant to the Marſhall <hi>de Termes,</hi> entred into the Towne with his companie of Lanciers. Thoſe of
<hi>Terrides</hi> and <hi>Monluc</hi> ſtayed without to hinder ſuch ayde as might arriue to helpe thoſe of the religion, that held but one gate, to whom about Euening, was ſent a letter into the Towne-houſe to make an accord, where vnto they appeared, onely demaunding aſſurance of their liues, and the reſt of their goodes: with the obſeruation of the Edict of Ianuarie, which was refuſed them. Whervpon each prepared themſelues vpon the next day after, to enter into a hotter fight then euer they did. And becauſe the cannon in the <pb n="145" facs="tcp:22081:73"/>Towne-houſe, did much hurt vnto the Towne, the Councellours and the Court cauſed more then two hundreth houſes to be burnt, and in diuers other places many houſes were robbed and ſpoyled: and among others, the houſes of Preſident <hi>Bernoy,</hi> and Councellour
<hi>Chauuet,</hi> where two yong maides were rauiſhed in their mothers preſence.</p>
               <p>Saturday the ſixteenth, they had a cruell skirmiſh, and then thoſe of the Romiſh Church asked a parley, and had a truce, which truce continuing, it was agreed vpon, that thoſe of the religion leauing their armor and weapons in the Town houſe, ſhuld withdraw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with all ſecuritie. And according to that agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t made with the Captains &amp; the Parliament, thoſe of the religion hauing receiued the Communion with teares &amp; ſolemne prayers, about eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning came foorth, where againſt the faith and promiſe made vnto them, they tooke all they could lay hold vppon, and committed them priſoners, and thoſe that got out at the gate, called
<hi>Villeneufue,</hi> many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſcaped &amp; were receiued into
<hi>Montaubon,</hi> &amp; other Towns that held for the religion. The ſouldiers ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered about the fields, and the Peſants killed and ſpoyled many of them. The common opinion is, that in this mutinie, there died within the Towne aboue three thouſand fiue hundreth perſons, as well on the one ſide as on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The foure and twentieth of May, <hi>Burie</hi> and
<hi>Monluc</hi> determining to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy <hi>Montauban,</hi> marched thither with an armie of a thouſand horſe,<note place="margin">The firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging of Montauban</note> and fiue thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d foote, wherwith they beſieged it, haning two fierce skirmiſhes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Towne, in one of them Captaine Saint <hi>Michell</hi> ſlewe three launciers, and tooke a goodly horſe. The next day the artillerie came thither, many skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes being made, wherein <hi>Monluc</hi> had the woorſt, and hardly eſcaped with his life, his horſe hauing been ſlaine vnder him: the next day, the campe diſlod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and made away in great haſte, but for what cauſe it was not known, <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luc</hi> hauing loſt about ſixtie men, but hee ſpoyled all the houſes round about it, and burnt the corne beeing halfe ripe. Not long after, Captaine Saint <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> and his brother beeing attainted of treaſon and robberie, were ſlaine in the houſe of <hi>Marchaſtell</hi> within <hi>Montauban.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The enemies laye in the Garriſons round about it, which cauſed thoſe of the twone to erect certaine companies, and a kinde of millitarie Diſcipline, and then to make iſſues and courſes in the countrie, which fell out with good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe: but not to thoſe of
<hi>Caſtres,</hi> who in one recountre, loſt betweene foure ſcore and a hundreth Souldiers, in a manner all young men borne within the towne.</p>
               <p>The three and twentieth of Auguſt, Captaine <hi>Bazourdan</hi> ſent by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Thoulouſe,</hi>

               <p>The laſt words vſed by <hi>Bazourdon,</hi> contained a certaine kinde of mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie touching the confidence that thoſe of
<hi>Montauban</hi> put in the Lord, but <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> their Miniſter tooke him vppe for halting. The fift of September, thoſe of
<hi>Negropeliſſe,</hi> hauing beene ſurpriſed and hardly handled by Captaine <hi>Coulumbier,</hi> and the Biſhoppe of <hi>Montauban,</hi> they ſought to remedie it, but all too late.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:22081:74"/>
               <p>The Biſhoppe cauſing ſixe of his beſt priſoners to bee ſtoned and beaten to death with ſtaues, and their bodies caſt into the riuer. In a ſallie made vppon the eight of the ſame moneth, thoſe of
<hi>Montauban</hi> beeing diſcouered by a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, were put to flight, hauing loſt one of the Enſigne-bearers, two Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralles, two Gentlemen, and tenne ſouldiers. The ſame day <hi>Marchaſtel</hi> and <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> beeing entered into <hi>Montauban,</hi> deſired that they might take the companies and the Artillerie with them, hauing lodged their armie within the Towne. which conſtrained the Conſuls to graunt to their deſires. But their arriuall fell out well for the Towne,<note place="margin">The ſecond ſiege of Montauban.</note> for that within three daies after, <hi>Burie</hi> and <hi>Monluc</hi> with nine companies of Lanciers, great numbers of Gentlemen, fiue and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie companies of footemen, foure companies of Argolitiers, and three compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Spaniards, each co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie of foure hundreth men, with fiue ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nons, three Coluerins, and fiue demy Coluerins, came to beſiege <hi>Montauban</hi> the ſecond time. At their arriuall, there happened a fierce and hard skirmiſh, the iſſue thereof being ſuch, that the aſſaylants left the place which they had taken, and withdrew themſelues ſomewhat further with great loſſe. Thoſe of the towne left the Maiſter of the campe to <hi>Monſieur Duras,</hi> a Sergeant of a band, a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, ſixe ſouldiers, and certaine ſtraungers, with diuers hurt. The next day, beeing the fifteenth of September, the skirmiſh began againe, to the dammage of the aſſaylantes, and foure ſcore Spaniards that had ſet fire in a Mill vpon the riuer of <hi>Tar,</hi> making good cheere in a farmers houſe, were ſurpriſed and all put to the ſword, not one eſcaping. The execution beeing done by fiue and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſouldiers of the Towne, that returned laden with armors and other ſpoyles in the face of the enemie, wherevppon ſome made foorth to go on the other ſide of the water to ayde their companions, but their boate ouerwhelmed, and they were almoſt all drowned. The next day, <hi>Duras</hi> preſented battell vnto <hi>Monluc,</hi> which he refuſed, and the next day raiſed his ſiege, hauing loſt about ſixe hundreth men, and the Towne thirtie.</p>
               <p>The third ſiege of <hi>Montauban</hi> with diuers skirmiſhes, ſallies, eſcalades, and other warlike practiſes, to the loſſe of both parts, continued vntill the fifteenth of Aprill,<note place="margin">A third ſiege of Montau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban.</note> that peace was proclaimed within <hi>Montauban:</hi> and in that third ſiege the enemie loſt (as they themſelues confeſſed) two thouſand ſouldiers, foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or fifteen Captaines, Lieftenants and Enſigne-bearers: and diuers Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of companies, beſides a great number of hurt and maimed men, that died in diuers places as they retired.</p>

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:22081:74"/>ſaued themſelues as well as they might, which thoſe of the towne perceiuing, made after them, ſlaying ſome, and hurting others. On the other ſide, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the baſe Towne, were ſlaine <hi>Iaques Sabatter</hi> his ſonne, and three or foure o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The 91. of May, three of the richeſt houſes therein, were ſacked and ſpoyled: and vpon Whitſunday, one of the religion beaten downe in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbes, beeing ſore wounded, they cut off his noſe, and eares, and pulled out his eyes. After that, fiue priſoners were hanged, many put to great ranſomes, and a Gentleman beheaded.

One of the number named <hi>Martin du Puits,</hi> a man that was rich, peaceable, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reproach or infamie, was taken in a farme without the Towne, and ſhortly after hanged, his bodie caſt vnto the dogs, hauing firſt blacked his face, hands, and feete, cauſing it to bee reported, that he had the diuell within him. Others beeing taken and ledde vnto

               <p>Touching thoſe that were abſent, the Conſuls and others, tooke their mooueables, tooke notes of their immooueables, tooke all they could find from the women, and yet conſtrained them to lodge and finde certaine ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, conſtrained with blowes to go to heare Maſſe, and their children re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſed.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of the religion beeing the ſtrongeſt within

Wherevppon there fell open warre betweene both parts, thoſe of the religion beeing ſtrengthed with fiftie ſouldiers that came from <hi>Foix,</hi> withſtood <hi>Pomas</hi> that came to ayde their aduerſaries with tenne companies, and eight hundreth Bandoliers, moſt part Spaniards, conducted by a notable murtherer called <hi>Pey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot Ioupian.</hi> Preſently after the deſolation of <hi>Thoulouſe,</hi> the Parliament ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Marſhall <hi>de Mirepoix,</hi> that beſieged and battered the great Towne, (which was holden by thoſe of the religion) with ſeuenteen peeces of Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but all in vaine. Wherevppon hee deuiſed another meanes, and vppon the ſixteenth of Iune he entered therein: by reaſon whereof, he executed all kind of monſterous cruelties, violating women and children moſt deteſtably without any deſcription of religion. The Miniſter was ſlaine, two Gentlemen and 60. ſouldiers taken priſoners, were hanged. A widdowe of great account hauing redeemed her onely daughters virginitie with a great ſumme of mony, the villaine that had ſworne to defend her, violated her in preſence of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then killed them both.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of the Romiſh Church were nothing ſpared, for that ſome of them were likewiſe ſlaine.

And the furie continued in ſuch ſort within that poore Towne, that after <pb n="148" facs="tcp:22081:75"/>the publication of the peace, at one time fourteene of the religion comming thither, were all ſlaine: and one of <hi>Monſieur de Ioyeuſes</hi> ſeruants hauing beene found to followe one of the iudges that was not well thought on, was ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and rifled in the open ſtreetes.</p>
               <p>The fifteenth of March 1592. both the parties within

<hi>Monſieur de Ioyeuſe</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied to the Conſtable, vſed all the meanes hee could to ſuppreſſe thoſe of the religion: but <hi>Monſieur de Baudine,</hi> appoynted commaunder ouer the troupes of the religion in
<hi>Languedoc,</hi> while the warres continued, interrupted him: and withall, ceaſed vppon <hi>Magalas</hi> a very ſtrong place, which much annoyed the Towne, forced <hi>Eſpignan,</hi> and there put moſt part of two companies of Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doliers to the ſword.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> followed by fiue thouſand men, foure Cannons, two Coluerins, two demy coluerins, and foure field peeces, went to beſiege the Caſtle of <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi> neare to <hi>Reziers,</hi> wherein were but twelue ſouldiers, with munition one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for two daies.
<hi>Baudine</hi> gaue <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> ſo much to doo, that they in the meane time ſaued themſelues: which done, he went to <hi>Lezignan,</hi> that held againſt the cannon ſhotte, but at the ſecond aſſault it was taken: and hauing by compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taken two companies of ſouldiers that kept <hi>Montagnac,</hi> with promiſe to ſaue their liues, falſifying his promiſe, hee put foure of the principall of them to the ſword. From thence he marched to <hi>Pezenas,</hi> where <hi>Baudine</hi> met him, and had ouerthrowne him, if it had not beene for the treaſon of the Maiſter of his campe, who ſet things in ſuch bad order, that <hi>Baudines</hi> troupes were the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in daunger to bee put to the ſword: and there hee loſt one hundreth, or an hundreth and twentie ſouldiers. This Marſhall not long after dying in <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſlier,</hi> confeſſed to haue receiued fiue hundreth Crownes of <hi>Monſieur de Ioyeuſe</hi> before the encounter, with promiſe of twiſe as much more. This loſſe, and the ſeparation of the troupes being much more, produced a parley, wherin <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> made ſo many goodly offers, that they ſuffered him to enter into <hi>Pezenas:</hi> but beeing entered, hee ſhewed them what hee ment, killing certaine hurt ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Inhabitants, that could not ſerue in the warres. His crueltie cauſed him to looſe <hi>Beziers,</hi> where when he thought to enter, he found a face of wood, and thoſe of <hi>Beziers</hi> readie in field, that forced and burnt <hi>Lignan,</hi> hauing ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne two companies that kept it. The warre beeing wholly turned againſt <hi>Montpeſlier,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Beziers</hi> fayled to be ſurpriſed by night, vppon the ſixteenth of October, their enemies hauing ſecretly gotten cloſe vnder the walles. But it chanced that a Drummer of the Town being drunke, about two of the clock at night ſuddainly roſe vp, and thinking it had beene day, beganne to ſound the Diana or morning watch, which cauſed the enemie to flie, whoſe lathers in the morning were found in the ditches. Wherevppon ſeuen or eight traitors were apprehended, and being found guiltie, were executed for the fact. And within eight daies after, the enemie came by day, cloſe to the Barriers: but to their loſſe, the principall of their troupe beeing hurt, where of he died. The ſecond of Nouember, thoſe of

               <p>The king of <hi>Spaine</hi> with that Ambaſſage, deuiſing how hee might ſee his kinſmans houſe in new troubles, tooke no order for his own in the lowe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where as then warres beganne to bee hatched, which not long after came foorth, and as yet continue therein, to his great ſhame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of March, the Queene beganne the voyage of

But the effect that both approached and enſued, did partly ſhewe the intents and ſecret practiſes of that woman and her Councell.</p>
               <p>The king beganne that voyage in <hi>Champagne</hi> and

               <p>But in the end the plague being entered into the Queens Chamber, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one of her Gentlewomen fell ſicke, the king was ledde from thence.

               <p>Thoſe of the religion indured all, contenting themſelues with ſimple de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations in paper, and receiuing paper for payment.

               <p>They ſware and aduowed a ſocietie, and <hi>Ignace</hi> being beheaded, they made certaine voyages to <hi>Parris, Rome,</hi> and
<hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and in the end went to <hi>Venice,</hi> where they continued certaine yeares. And perceiuing themſelues to haue many followers,<note place="margin">Their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</note> went to
<hi>Rome,</hi> where they beganne to make open profeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their order, among other articles, chiefely promiſing two things: the one, that their principall intent was, to preach the word of God vnto the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans: to conuert them to the faith: the other, freely to teach all chriſtians the ſtudie of learning: and to accommodate their name vnto their deuotionss they called themſelues religious perſons of the ſocietie of Ieſus: preſenting themſelues vnto Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third,<note place="margin">Their name.</note> of the houſe of <hi>Ferneſe,</hi> about the yeare of our Lord,
1540. at the ſame time that the Almaines began to arme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt the alteration of religion, and becauſe one of the principall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations of the Almaines, was touching the authoritie of the Pope, whom
<hi>Martin Luther</hi> ſought to deface, they with a contrary profeſsion ſhewed, that their firſt vow was to acknowledge the Pope to be aboue al earthly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,<note place="margin">At what time they began.</note> and aboue the generall Councelles, and the vniuerſall Church. The Pope, who at the firſt made doubt to allow them, and after, had permitted them to name themſelues religious, but with charge that they ſhould not exceed the number of ſixtie perſons, began to hearken to this promiſe, and to open the gate to their deuotion: and after him, Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the third, vntill Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth named <hi>Theatin,</hi> the firſt Promoter of that order, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed them fully and wholly, with many and great priuiledges.</p>

<hi>Parris,</hi> whither hee brought <hi>Paſquier Brouet,</hi> with three or foure others.

                  <note place="margin">Their bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> oppoſed himſelfe againſt their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts: not that hee fauoured not the Catholicque religion, but for that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all things, hee doubted and feared ſuch nouelties, as mother of many errors, ſpecially in religion.

The Court not content with thoſe oppoſitions, wold not ſeem to be opinious of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but for the ſame cauſe had recourſe vnto the facultie of Diuines, who by their decree cenſured againſt them, partly becauſe that ſome of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition derogated from the priuiledges of the French Churches, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that terming themſelues religious, they weare not the habit, neyther yet confined themſelues (like vnto others) within Cloyſters: which cenſure put them by their whole intent.</p>

               <p>Not long after, the Biſhop of <hi>Cleremont</hi> died, who by his will bequeathed them great gifts, thoſe legacies by them recouered, happened the firſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, at the beginning whereof, the conference of the French Church was holden in <hi>Poſſy.</hi> From that time they began to breake their long ſilence, and againe preſented a requeſt to the Court of Parltament, to be receiued and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued, if not in ſorme of religion, yet as a ſimple Colledge.<note place="margin">Their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement.</note> The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made account, that this requeſt touched the ſuperiors of the Church, wherevpnon they referred it to the aſſembly at <hi>Poſſy,</hi> where the Cardinall of <hi>Turnon</hi> was Preſident, as the eldeſt Prelate, who had founded a company of their name within the town of

This decree was ſet downe word for word in the regiſters of the Court. Not long after, they bought a houſe within <hi>Parris</hi> in <hi>S.

In this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany were diuers learned perſons, &amp; among the reſt, Fryer <hi>Edmond Anger,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Maldonnat:</hi> the firſt, a great Preacher: the ſecond, one that had bin inſtructed in all kinds of learning and languages:<note place="margin">Their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.</note> a great Diuine and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher. They being ſent to anounce their doctrine, were wel accepted, and by that means drew great numbers of Schollers vnto them, and perceiuing the wind to blow with them, they preſented a requeſt to the Rector of <hi>Parris,</hi> to be vnited and incorporated into the vniuerſitie, whervpon a Congregation was aſſembled at the <hi>Mathurins,</hi> where it was concluded,<note place="margin">Who ſtroue againſt them</note> that they ſhould certifie before they paſſed forward, whether they bare the name &amp; qualitie of regulers or ſeculers: which reduced them to great perplexitie.

And it was agreed, that the parties ſhuld plead vpon the firſt day of the opening of the Court. Theſe are the words of M. <hi>Stephen Paſquier,</hi> adding thervnto.

They bear the name of Ieſus, but with a falſe title. I am of opinion, that there is not any faithful chriſtian, or good and loyal Frenchman, but that wil find the reaſons and concluſions of the vniuerſitie to be both iuſt and good:
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:22081:91"/>which is,<note place="margin">Certain alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to be noted in the declaration of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie.</note> that not only this new world, which by a title, partiall, arrogant, and ambitious, affirmeth it ſelfe onely, to bee of the ſocietie of Ieſus, ought not to bee adopted nor incorporated into the body of our Vniuerſitie, but that it ought wholly to bee banniſhed, tooted out, and exterminated out of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe new bretheren, vnder a beautifull title, &amp; exterior ſhew, wold enter &amp; make a breach into our peace &amp; quiet eſtate.
<hi>Ignace</hi> a maimed ſouldier, not for the zeale and deuotion that hee bare to any new auſteritie of life, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing himſelfe to be impotent and vnable anylonger to beare armes, ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into familiaritie with certaine perſons, and among others, with one M. <hi>Paſquier Brouet,</hi> borne in
<hi>Dreux,</hi> a man (certain exterior quallities excepted) that had no learning, either in humane or diuine laws. Theſe two with ſome others, for a time kept themſelues in <hi>Venice,</hi> a town by certain Italian authors well knowne, and acknowledged to be the receptacle of diuers and peruerſe things.</p>
               <p>There for a time they vſed a certain hypocriticall auſteritie of life, &amp; percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that their ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be followed, they were ſo bold as to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port themſelues to <hi>Rome,</hi> wher they began to publiſh their ſect. And althogh the greateſt part of them were neither ſeen in tongues nor diuinitie, yet they began openly to promiſe two things. The one to preach the goſpel to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, ſo to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uert them to the faith: the other, to teach doctrine vnto al chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians without any reward. For that cauſe taking vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them the name of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious people, as if al thoſe that cleaued not to their ſect, were ſeparated from their ſocietie.</p>

               <p>The others of leſſer obſeruance, are bound onely to two vowes: the one, reſpecting their fidelitie that they promiſe to the Pope: the other, their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their ſuperior.</p>

               <p>This is the courſe whereby they haue at chieued ſuch wealth &amp; riches in this new order: for al that falleth to theſe leſſer obſeruantiues, by ſucceſsion, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, <pb n="181" facs="tcp:22081:91"/>chace, or any other practiſe, is incorporate into the whole bodie of Ieſuites, without repetition or reuocation: for euen they to whom it falleth haue vowed obedience.

In the firſt two, the opinions reſted very diuers, neuertheleſſe, rather by the Admirals counſell then otherwiſe, euery man was intreated a while to haue patience, and the rather for that in matters of ſuch conſequence, as wherevppon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended ſo many miſeries and calamities, it was more neceſſary to be drawne in by neceſsitie, then to make too much haſte, or vppon a greedie deſire to runne on headlong: beſides that, ſhortly matters would bee made more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant: but in the laſt conſultation they grewe into a greater heate.</p>
               <p>For beſides all paſſed calamities or imminent daungers, alſo that they of the religion were openly threatned, throughout moſt townes and Prouinces, that they ſhould not long beare themſelues ſo high, and that their time drew night to an end, they receiued more aduiſe out of ſundrie places: and both the Prince and Admirall did plainely affirme, that they had expreſſe aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from a certaine Courtier very well affected to thoſe of the religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that there had been holden a moſt ſecret Councel: wherein it was concluded, that they ſhould bee ſeized vpon: that the one ſhould bee executed, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther detained priſoner: that at the ſame inſtant, two thouſand Switzers, ſhuld enter into

In the end it was concluded, to riſe in armes, and in that beginning of war to obſerue foure things: the firſt, to hold but fewe townes but ſuch as ſhuld bee of importance: the ſecond, to raiſe a great armie: the third, to ouerthrow the Switzers, by whoſe meanes the Catholicques would alwaies bee Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the field: the fourth, to aſſay if they could driue the Cardinall of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine</hi> from the Court, becauſe many imagined that hee onely was the man, that ſtill ſolicited the king to deſtroye all thoſe of the religion.

Yet in fine, they were confuted by this reply, that the effects would plainly ſhew, what the intent of the Prince and his aſſociates was: as the euent manifeſtly ſhewed in the actions of
<hi>Charles</hi> the ſeuenth, as then beeing but <hi>Dauphine,</hi> when he raiſed armes, yet neyther againſt his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nor the Realme.</p>
               <p>Further, that it was well knowne, that the Frenchmen themſelues neuer attempted any thing againſt their Prince. Laſtly, that if this firſt ſucceſſe fell out fauorably, that it would be the means to cut off the courſe of a long and troubleſom war, becauſe therby they ſhuld haue means to let the king know the truth of thoſe things which were diguiſed vnto him: wherevpon might enſue the confirmation of the Edicts, ſpecially when thoſe that arme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to preuent, ſhall finde themſelues preuented.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The ſucceſſe of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces reſolution</note>This (as ſaith the Lord <hi>de la Noue</hi> in his diſcourſes) was the reſolution of the Lords and Gentlemen, that at that time were about the Prince, who (as hee addeth) albeit they were men of great experience, skill, valor, and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, yet al that they had ſo diligently pondered, and ſo well forecaſt, when it came to the effect, fell out wonderfull ſhort of their expectation: whileſt other things whereof they had ſo farre drempt, as thinking them ouer ſure, or difficult, redounded to their good, and ſtood them in ſtead. A while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they reſolued vpon this neceſsitie, as the Switzers marched on, firſt the Prince, and then the Admirall, made a iourney to the Court, where they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared each after other, to the king, to his mother, and to the Councell, that there was no reaſon, neither any iuſt occaſion, to make this leuie of ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Switzers, &amp; to bring them into the Realme, vnleſſe paradu enture they had ſome pretence to imploy them vpon the ruine of thoſe of the religion, of whom there were yet remaining a greater multitude then they imagined, whereof the late warres might beare witneſſe: withall, that if their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies <pb n="186" facs="tcp:22081:94"/>practiſed ought but good, they would ſtand vpon their guard, and not haue their throates cut by theeues and perturbers of the publike peace: and heerevppon alſo they beſought the king to take compaſsion of ſo many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt families throughout his Realme: but they were denied and hardly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated: yea, the Prince at one time was in great hazard of his life: againſt whom the Courtiers had incenſed the Duke of
<hi>Aniou</hi> the kings bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who ſuddainly entered into a ſharpe braule againſt him, ſeeking all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to do him a ſhrewd turne: but the Prince both wiſe and eloquent, aunſwered him ſo pertinently to whatſoeuer the queſtions and violent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of him whom hee was to reuerence, who alſo was at that time inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with thoſe that would not ſticke to ſtrike, that the ſnare was broken, whereby hee eſcaped, and from that time came no more to the Court.</p>
               <p>To returne to the ſucceſſe of the enterpriſe of the Prince and his parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, they were forced of neceſsitie eyther to oppoſe themſelues againſt the cruell reſolution of their enemirs in

<hi>Lyons, Thoulouſe,</hi> and <hi>Troys,</hi> all very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for the warres. But the meanes vſed by thoſe that tooke the charge vppon them, were not well effected, in regard they were ouer many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and of ſmall experience and ſucfficiencie in ſuch affaires, who held their conſultations of that which ſhould bee done while they lay in their beddes, or ſat in their counting-houſes. Touching their ſtrength in field, thoſe of the religion had more in the beginning then the Catholicques, but ſixe weekes after the raiſing of armes, about the end of Septemb. they found themſelues the ſtrongeſt, whereby they conſtrained the Prince and the Admirall to ſeek refuge in <hi>Almaine</hi> from Duke
<hi>Caſimeire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The execution againſt the Switzers ſucceeded but croſly, becauſe it was diſcouered, and that the forces that ſhould haue met in time and place ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. The Cardinall of <hi>Lorraine</hi> ſaued himſelfe in great haſte, and fledde from the Court, and yet he kept his credite in the Court, being able to do as much abſent, as preſent. To the contrary, the Prince and his partaker fell into great difficulties, by prouoking the hatred and collor of the king againſt them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe through their meanes hee was conſtrained to go from <hi>Meaux</hi> to <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> with great feare, although hee had ſixe thouſand Switzers about him; beſides horſemen the Prince at his approaching hauing betweene foure and fiue hundreth horſe at the moſt, neuertheleſſe, it was put into the kings head, that he ſought to attempt againſt his perſon, ſo that from thenceforward, he alwaies had a ſecret grudge againſt them.

The Prince hoped to conſtraine them to fight, and that his forces being vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if hee might bee victor, to bring his enemies vnto a more aſſured peace, then that hee made before: and if hee were ouerthrowne, the places which hee held vppon the riuer of <hi>Marne</hi> and <hi>Seyne,</hi> would ſerue him for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait, ſtaying for the Rutters that beganne to ſtirre, with his forces of <hi>Guyenne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Conſtable to the contrary, hauing taken the view of the Princes lodging and forces, determined to giue them battell, aſſuring himſelfe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without reſiſtance: for that beſides his number of men, being tenne for one, he had great ſtore of Ordinance, and pikes, and a faire fielde well fitting for his troupes and cannons.

There young <hi>Lanſac</hi> in his ſecond voyage to <hi>Almaine</hi> was taken, and beeing brought priſoner to the Prince, all his buſineſſe turned into ſmoke. In the moneth of December vppon ſome moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of peace, there were two truces agreed vpon, each for two or three daies, to the end (as the voyce went) to conferre vpon the poynts propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

               <p>The Prince waying the wrong that his enemies had wrought to their owne reputation, in weening to indomage him, determined no longer to truſt their promiſes, (in which conceit notwithſtanding hee did not long perſeuer) vppon his concluſion in three daies ſpace, hee made his armie to march aboue twentie long leagues, through the raine and ſuch hard paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that it was wonderfull that the artillerie &amp; baggage could euer follow: and yet loſt neyther the one nor the other, ſo good was his order, and ſo great their diligence.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Aniou</hi> followed not: for ſome of his Councell making great haſte, perſwaded him that his very name had driuen the Huguenots out of <hi>France:</hi> whereas ſuch as were indeed warriors, did contrariwiſe accuſe the cowardlineſſe of thoſe that had ſo ſuffered the Prince &amp; his followers to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, as not daring to fight with them, eyther weake or halfe ſtrong.

It is true, that the Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a friend to peace, had likewiſe ſome inclination thervnto: but the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall perceiued the infruction thereof, and that this edict was but a ſnare to intrap both great and ſmall. For that as then certaine babling Romiſh Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licques could not refrain to ſay, that the day of their reuenge approached. A Gentleman that accompanied the Cardinall of <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> ſent word that hee had oftentimes heard ſuch ſpeeches, &amp; perceiued a great indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hidden in the hearts of ſome of the Deputies for the Queen, &amp; that they ſhuld looke vnto it: as being a ſigne and foreſhewing of ſome ſiniſter chance. Likewiſe there were ſome of the Court, as wel men as women, who ſometimes gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red words caſt out vpon the ſuddain, that ſent vnto their kinſmen &amp; friends in the Princes campe, to certifie them, that without all doubt they ſhuld be deceiued, if they wrought not wiſely, which in a maner was to waken thoſe that deſired nothing but to ſleep vpon the ſoft pillow of peace. But what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe ſoeuer was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it was impoſsible to ſtay that tempeſt of minds, enſuing in Maſſe of miſchiefes, ſhadowed with the vaile of a royall pacification.</p>
               <p>If any man thinke it ſtraunge, how theſe two commaunders that had ſo much credit with their participants, could not as then perſwade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their benefits, let them conſider what voluntarie ſouldiers are, and the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire man hath to returne vnto his houſe, and then hee ſhall well perceiue, that it is wholly beyond mans power, to ſtaye ſuch as were borne away with ſo impituous a ſtorme of humane paſsions.

               <p>Some of the Nobilitie deſired to returne into their Prouince, for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their families ſacked by the enemy.

Their reaſon was, that the body of their French forces forſaking them, they ſhould bee conſtrained to put themſelues to defenſiue warre, which they eſteemed not to be good for them, ſeeing as then it was in the month of March, a time when commonly all armies vſe to enter into the field, to ſeparate the Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and ſo to diſtribute them in their townes, was as much as to deuoure themſelues: and to incampe in a ſtrong place, would bee a remedie but for a time. So that to conclude, they reſolued, that of force they muſt hazard that poſted and moſt daungerous peace, which would conſtraine thoſe that as then left their campe, to acknowledge (but too late) their fault commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Then they could well haue deſired to haue had ſome townes of the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance: but when they asked other aſſurances then the Edicts, promiſes, and oathes, the Queene, her ſonnes, and their Councellors, caſt fire out of their mouthes, crying out and ſaying: that thoſe of the religion ſought to deſpiſe, and not account of the kings authoritie. To be ſhort, and euill ſhame cauſed them to receiue a peace in paper, couerture of a bloodie war, which ſtayed not long to ſhew it ſelfe.

The Prince had withdrawne himſelfe to his Caſtle of

To be ſhort, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two months ſpace, the Prince and his partakers, of poore vacabondes as they were at the firſt, became ſo wealthie, that they were able to continue a long war. In al theſe places they lodged ſome thirtie companies of footmen, and ſeuen or eight cornets of horſe, which was a great ſauing for the fielde, and they formed a moſt pollitieque &amp; militarie order as wel for the French, as for the conduct of their armie. Thus throgh neceſsitie, togither with oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, they of the religion found meanes to make vſe of both: and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral was wont to their aduenture, to attribute the ancient prouerbe of <hi>The miſlocles,</hi> ſaying to his familiers: <hi>Had we not been loſt, we had been loſt:</hi> Meaning, that had they not committed an ouerſight, they had not had ſo great a reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie, as that which did farre ſurpaſſe their former condition.

But god by thoſe obſcure beginnings, made an entrie into the notable iudgements which after that appeared. It may be, that the ioy they had at <hi>Parris,</hi> to ſee the Townes and Prouinces left, which had made ſo long and hard war againſt the Parriſians, during the firſt &amp; ſecond troubles, made diuers of their harts ſo much in flamed, that they diſdaind their enemies that were ſo far off, eſteeming that <hi>Rochel</hi> alone could not reſiſt them, but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 3. month, after, they ſhuld be incloſed therin: which diſcourſes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly made when our proſperitie is geater then we expect.

               <p>For which cauſes beeing atiained to the ſaid age of Maioritie, hee fore bad all exerciſe thereof, in the countries of his obedience: commaunding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reuocation, that there ſhould be no other exerciſe of religion, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of the Romiſh Church, vpon paine of loſſe of bodie and goods.

               <p>At the ſame inſtant an other edict was publiſhed, certifying, that from thencefoorth, the king intended not to bee ſerued with any offices, beeing of that profeſsion, from that time forward diſcharging them of all their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, commaunding them to yeelde them vpto him within fifteene daies af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, otherwiſe hee would take ſome ſtricter order therein.</p>
               <p>Theſe Edicts had been long hatching: but their hope was to intrappe the Prince and the Admirall:<note place="margin">The effects of ſuch edicts</note> wherein hauing failed to get mony of the Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and the third eſtate, the Queene and thoſe of <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſerued themſelues with this deuiſe, which was to no great end.

But at this alarme they aſſayed to ioyne with the troupes: further, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunders ſent certaine declarations into
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Almaine,</hi> to ſhewe, that they were not purſued as ſeditious perſons, or ſuch as deſired a Crown, (as their aduerſaries reported) but onely becauſe of the religion, which the Romiſh Catholicques ſought to extirminate <hi>France:</hi> which ſerued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> well, for the furtherance of the leuie of Rutters, which the next yeare came into
<hi>France,</hi> vnder the conduct of the Duke <hi>de Deux Ponts.</hi> Alſo there were many about the king, the Queen, and the Duke of <hi>Aniou,</hi> that deſired nothing elſe but to ſee all the countrie flaming with fire: ſome to robbe and ſpoyle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out puniſhment: others to execute their vengeances and reuenges: the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to cauſe the Frenchmen to cut each others throat, thoſe of <hi>Guiſe</hi> by litle and litle to attaine to the aduancement of their deſeignments, which diſcouered themſelues in the end of the raigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the thrid, as you ſhall read.</p>
               <p>After theſe Edicts, the Duke of <hi>Aniou</hi> made preparation for all things neceſſarie for his voyage, and ſo puiſſant an armie, whereof by the king hee was made Lieftenant generall. That which increaſed the Princes troupes, was the Regiment of foot, which <hi>Monſieur d'Acier</hi> brought out of <hi>Dauphine, Prouence,</hi> and
<hi>Languedoc,</hi> not long before the Prince had written vnto him, as alſo to diuers Captaines in thoſe Prouinces, that they ſhould vſe all the means they could, to prouide him a certaine number of men, therewith to withſtand the armie royall, that came to aſſayle him: that the Princes, Lords, <pb n="200" facs="tcp:22081:101"/>and other commaunders, might not indure ſo great diſaduantage, to bee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged within a towne: and it fell out ſo, that
<hi>Acier, Mouuans</hi> and others, not neglecting this commaundement, made ſo great a troupe of men,<note place="margin">Forces out of Dauphin, Prouence, and Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc, for the Prince.</note> as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that they had wholly vnpeopled thoſe three Prouinces, hauing at the leaſt ſixteene or ſeuenteene thouſand Harquebuſiers marching along. <hi>Gour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> Gouernour of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> vſed all the meanes hee could to impeach their paſſage ouer the riuer of <hi>Rhoſne:</hi> but they hauing ſeized vppon diuers places that might bee commodious for them, and with eaſe croſsing that great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, went to <hi>Allais,</hi> and ſo marched towards
<hi>Millaud</hi> to enter into <hi>Perigueux.</hi> Now as on the one ſide, this troupe of footemen was the ſtrength of the Princes armie, ſo was it the cauſe of the loſſe of diuers places, which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicques ſeized vppon after the departure of <hi>Acier</hi> and other commanders, whereof diuers repented themſelues to haue leuyed ſo many men, whereof the halfe would haue ſufficed, marching cloſe and in good order: but the iealouſie among the principall leaders, the ſtaying of ſome, and the aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of others, was the meanes that they could not ioyne with the Prince, before they had receiued a hard checke: two of their regiments beeing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by the Duke
<hi>de Montpenſieur,</hi> becauſe that <hi>Mouuans</hi> and <hi>Pierre Gourdes</hi> Collonels, perceiuing themſelues hindered by lodging ſo cloſe as they had done, till they were not farre from <hi>Perigort,</hi> ſought to ſeparate themſelues and lie in a village called
<hi>Menſignac,</hi> beeing of opinion, that with two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſany Harquebuſiers they might withſtand a whole armie. <hi>Mouuans</hi> had both valour and pollicie, as much as any Captain of footmen euer had in his time. But his courage cauſed him at that time to take vpon him too great a charge: for beeing ſet vpon on all ſides,<note place="margin">The ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe of Mouans &amp; Gourde.</note> and by ſixe times as many men, yet he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to fight valiantly: but in fine, both hee and his companions were ſlaine in the field, with the number of a thouſand of their men, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach
<hi>Acier,</hi> lodging about two ſmall leagues from thence, with ſixe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foote, from comming to ayde them, at the ſame time that
<hi>Mouuans</hi> was charged by the Dukes footemen, they ſent eight or nine launciers and diuers Harquebuſiers on horſebacke towards <hi>Acier,</hi> that cried battell, and made a great noyſe with trumpets.<note place="margin">A ſtratagem to hinder aide</note> Whereat <hi>Acier</hi> was ſo much buſied to looke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe, that in the mean time <hi>Mouuans</hi> and his troupes ſuſtained the force of their enemies, ſelling their liues as well as they might, in ſuch ſort, that the Catholicques loſt aboue a hundreth men, and were ſo moyled with the fight and the trauell their horſe had made at that ſame day, that they could not purſue nor charge <hi>Aciers</hi> troupes, abaſhed at the report of thoſe that had eſcaped, that made the Duke of <hi>Montpenſiers</hi> forces to bee farre greater then they were.</p>

                  <note place="margin">What the two armies did lying ſo neare togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note>After this ouerthrow of <hi>Mouuans,</hi> the Duke of

<hi>Dauphinois</hi> of their companions, ſhould haue ſet vpon him in ſome place of diſaduantage. There he found the Duke of <hi>Anion,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with very reſolutetroupes, and a great number of Noble men and Captaines greatly affectionate to this poore Prince. There had not been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny daies ſeene two ſuch armies of French men. The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> his pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces furniſhed, had eighteene thouſand Harquebuſiers, and three thouſand good horſe. In the Dukes armie they had no leſſe then tenne thouſand foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <pb n="201" facs="tcp:22081:101"/>beſides the Switzers, and foure thouſand lances: ſo that on both ſides there were fiue and thirtie thouſand Frenchmen, all trained men, and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture as good ſouldiers as any in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They of the religion conſidering their ſtrength, endeuored to haue come to handie blowes, and came within two leagues of
<hi>Chaſtelleraud,</hi> but the Prince beeing giuen to vnderſtand, that the other campe was lodged in a very conuenient place, and almoſt inuironed with a ſmall mariſh, holpen with ſome ſleight intrenchment in diuers places, would not make any raſh attempt, but ſoght all other meanes to drawe his enemie to the field.<note place="margin">The Prince ſeeketh bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and way.</note> Heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto was he eſpecially inuited, in regard as well of his number, as their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe, withall, fearing that ſuch armies wanting ſcope ſufficient, could not continue or hold any long time: beſides that, the winter, which this yeare was moſt extreame, would ſoone duminiſh the ſame. The Romiſh Catholiques were not altogither ſo outragious, but expected a ſupply, withall, thinking themſelues able in time to wearie their enemie, and by litle and little to breake them.</p>
               <p>The two leaders were very deſirous to ioyne, namely the Duke of <hi>Aniou,</hi> who fretted mightily to ſee ſo many men at the Princes commaund: beſides that, he heard that the Germaines were buſtling and preparing in the ſpring to come into <hi>France</hi> for him.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, they both had one intent, namely, each to liue vppon the enemies countrie, and ſo to ſpare their owne from the extreame waſte com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the man of warre. But the prouidence of the almightie,<note place="margin">The purpoſes of both the leaders.</note> would not permit the French to put in execution the mallice of their harts: for had they then buckeled, the ſinues of the kingdome had been cut in peeces, and by all likelyhood it had been paſt recouery, and beene made a pray to any mightie forraine enemie, that liſts ſuddainly to haue ſeized thervpon. Now let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde how his wiſe prouidence ordered all matters at that time. Both the armies breaking vp, drewe towards <hi>Luſignan,</hi> neare wherevnto there lyeth a ſmal quarter moſt fruitfull, where each pretended to lodge:<note place="margin">The Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and his brother in danger of an ouerthrow.</note> and albeit they were ſo neare togither, yet did not the one know of the other, whereby it fell out, that the generall <hi>Rendez-vous</hi> of both armies, was appoynted in a great Burrow called <hi>Pampron,</hi> ſome fiue leagues from
<hi>Poictiers,</hi> a town plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully prouided of victuals, where the Marſhals of both the campes met in maner at one inſtant with their troupes, ſo that twiſe or thriſe they driue and were driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, each ſide coueting that lodging which at length was abandoned. But knowing that they ſhould be relieued, neither ſide would flie, but took their ſtands, ſome quarter of a league off, where they put themſelues in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray: for the ſupport of the one ſide, came the Admiral and his brother with fiue cornets of horſe: and for the Duke of <hi>Anious</hi> part, ſome ſeuen or eight hundreth launces.</p>
               <p>Now are wee not ſaid the Admirall, to ſtand vppon lodgings, but to fight, and ſo ſuddainly aduiſed the Prince heereof, who was a long league behinde, willing him to come forward, whileſt hee kept the enemie playe. Then did he ſet his men in order vppon a little riſing, the rather to take from the Romiſh Catholicques the ſight of a ſmall valley, whereby they might haue had a perfect view of him, as alſo to make them thinke that the ſaid val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley <pb n="202" facs="tcp:22081:102"/>had been full both of horſemen and footmen. Standing thus within can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non ſhot each of other, the Admirall commanded a Captaine of Argoletiers, to march ſome fiue hundreth paces, and there to ſtay near vnto a hedge: but as ſuch men are not alwaies of like wiſedome, courage, and readineſſe, the one halfe immediately made to the skirmiſh, whom their Cornet followed to relieue them. The Duke of
<hi>Martigues,</hi> leader of the other ſide, weening that they would haue fought, ſtood cloſe, and ſent forth three or foure ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons of lanciers. The Admirall and his brother greeuing that they had not foreſeene the folly of this Captaine of the Argoletiers, wiſt not wherevpon to reſolue, becauſe they ſaw the enemie much ſtronger then themſelues: but comming to giue their opinions, they both concluded contrary to their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome and nature. <hi>Andelot</hi> a knight without feare, and one that neuer found any thing too hotte,<note place="margin">A notable example of the infirmitie of mans iudgement in matters of importance.</note> though it beſt to retire a ſoft pace, and ſo giue a foyle to the enemie, that was much ſtronger then they, which was to bee preſerred before the danger, which being once auoyded, beſides the profit, they ſhuld alſo reape honour. The Admirall thought it better to ſtaye, and with a good face to hide their weakneſſe, and thervpon immediately called back his skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhers, wherevpon the enemies lanciers made at. This counſell had beſt ſucceſſe, notwithſtanding the other ſeemed the better, and of more ſafetie. For <hi>Martiques</hi> afterward gaue out, that had hee knowne the Admirall and his bretheren to haue been ſo weake, it ſhould haue coſt him the liues of all his lanciers, but he wold haue had thoſe two Lords either quicke or dead: that he tooke their fiue cornets to haue been the troupes of the Marſhals of the field, whom they had charged, and ſo doubted they had been ſupported by ſome ſtore of Harquebuſiers, which he ſeemed to diſcerne in a village be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them, who indeed were no other but their varlets: beſides that, for want of footemen, whom he expected, hee had loſt the opportunitie of a field.<note place="margin">The Prince looſeth oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feate the D. of Anious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuantgard.</note> Thus do the hazards of warre depend vpon very ſuddaine moments. Within one houre after this aduenture, they all looked for a field, for on all ſides ye might diſcerne the footemens Enſignes and troupes of horſemen come marching on: but it was late before they were all come togither, ſo as they had onely a hotte skirmiſh, which the night brake off. There was no more but the D. of
<hi>Anious</hi> auantgard, whoſe leaders perceiuing the Princes campe to be too ſtrong, deuiſed a pollicie to make them thinke it to be their whole armie: for they cauſed part of the French drummes to ſtrike vppe the Switzers march, forbidding their ſouldiers not to disband, but only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelues, leaſt by the taking of any priſoner, the enemies ſhould haue knowne the truth: for had the Prince knowne of it, this auantgard had been ouerthrown and defeated. Beſides they doubled their guards, made great fires, and cauſed their ſouldiers to hang burning matches vpon the buſhes. and ſo hauing taken their repaſt, they departed with ſmall noyſe, and drewe ſome to <hi>Iaſenueil,</hi> where the D. of
<hi>Aniou</hi> lodged with his battell, and ſome to the borought of
<hi>Sanſſay,</hi> which is within one league of it. The Prince at three of the clocke after midnight, had notice of their going, and at fiue followed with his whole armie, as doubting that theirs came not then. Thus in one day we may ſee two notable opportunities loſt, the firſt by the Duke, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond by the prince: yet may we not greatly blame either y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one or the other, for ſuch occaſions are hardly found at the firſt, and in two or three houres they are paſſed. Then it is, that ſome ſmall aduertiſement might plainly haue <pb n="203" facs="tcp:22081:102"/>reuealed them: but that is a benefit of felicitie, which dependeth not vppon the Captains ſufficiencie. All that we haue ſpoken of the former daies work, is nothing in regard of that which happened the next day at <hi>Iaſenueil,</hi> where it ſeemeth that God verified the ſaying of his Prophet: that he would ſubuert the counſels of men: alſo that al the waies of the mightie are in his hands, as well as of the meaner. For many things fell out rather by hazard, &amp; at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture, then by any counſell or aduiſe. The Princes determination was, to follow his enemies campe, that as then diſlodged,<note place="margin">The battelt of Iaſenueil.</note> and whereſoeuer hee found it, to fight with them: wherevpon the Admirall and the Prince pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued after them. Now comming to two waies, the one leading to the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage called <hi>Sanſſay,</hi> the other to <hi>Iaſenueil:</hi> the Prince left the firſt and tooke the laſt, which hee did becauſe of a miſt that roſe before the breake of day. The forefront which the Admirall had ſet before him, and was very ſtrong, about eight of the clocke in the morning entered into <hi>Sanſſay,</hi> wherein fiue or ſix hundreth horſes were lodged, that were preſently conſtrained in haſte to diſlodge, hauing loſt all their carriage, and were purſued very farre. Mean time the Prince keeping on the way which he had choſen, hauing marched aboue two leagues, found himſelfe in the face of the armie of the Duke of <hi>Anion,</hi> not knowing what was become of his vantgard. He perceiuing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to bee ſo neare, determined not to retire: and becauſe the countrie was ſtrong, he cauſed his Harquebuſiers to bee placed in the head, beeing aboue 12000, beginning to skirmiſh, ſending to the Admirall, whom he knew not where to finde, to certifie him that he was conſtrained to make ſhew to fight, finding himſelfe ſo neare to the D. of <hi>Anious</hi> campe, and that he ſhould make all the haſte hee could to come vnto him. Before the meſſenger was halfe way, the Admiral aduertiſed by the ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>non ſhot, doubted the woorſt, &amp; in all haſte made towards the noyſe, with thoſe troupes he could aſſemble. But at his arriual the ſun began to go down, which kept them from determining, viewing, or enterpriſing vpon the great armies. Al doing nothing, but skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed in ſuch ſort, as of long time the like had not been ſeene: and which put the D. armie in ſome feare, as being in a place of great diſaduantage: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thogh it made a good ſhew, not one ſeeing the other: beeing hidden within the hedges &amp; valleis, none but the Harquebuſiers being ſcattered, could bee perceiued. The Princes ſide was very couragious,<note place="margin">A pleaſant conceit.</note> but their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duction not anſwerable, ſhooting as in a ſhew of pleaſure very cloſe, a whole Regiment diſcharging togither. To the contrary, the Dukes were ſeparated, ſhooting at leiſure &amp; in ſmall troupes, in ſuch ſort, that 200. Harq. ſtayed a whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princes. The loſſe fel on both ſides, &amp; many hurt, as it happeneth in ſuch conflicts. At the ſame time there chanced a merrie conceit, that put many in great feare, while they made alte, al the Princes cariage ſtayed along by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wood, not far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reaward of the horſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wher the Pages &amp; other Ieruants placed themſelues, thinking they ſhuld haue camped in that place, making at the leaſt aboue 4000. fiers: &amp; perceiued not the armie to retire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was night, in ſuch maner, that diuers of their maiſters ſupped but ſle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly that euening. Some of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> D. armie that held y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> watch, perceiuing ſo many fiers &amp; great noyſe, they thought verily it had bin the Princes armie, wherby they looked for battel the next day in the morning, which made them vſe more diligence to fortifie their paſſages. Cap. <hi>Garies</hi> offered to view the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but they wold not hazard the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues againſt thoſe braue warriors y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſat prating by their fiers. About midnight, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince was certified y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al his carriages were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled, <pb n="204" facs="tcp:22081:103"/>and made account they were loſt, neuertheleſſe he deferred not to ſend four or fiue cornets of horſe to fetch them, commaunding that an houre after, a thouſand horſe, and two thouſand Harquebuſiers ſhould march thither to ayde them, if the enemie ſhould follow. The firſt that arriued among them, found them in goodly ordinance, warming themſelues, ſinging, and making good cheare, and being farre from them, you would verily haue thought they had beene aboue ten thouſand men, they thinking no more vppon the matter, then if they had beene within a walled towne. They began to laugh at the behauiour of thoſe braue fellowes, who ordinarily are as fearefull as hares, although they are in ſafetie, and there beeing readie to be ſlaine, they did nothing but hoope and hollow, becauſe they ſupped well with their Maiſters victuals. The firſt of the Princes horſemen being come to the head of this goodly campe, were not ouer courteouſly receiued, for that the moſt aſſured among them, had placed their guards and Sentinels, and as farre as they could diſcerne a man, althogh they cried at the leaſt a hundreth times, friends: yet they aunſwered not but with caliuer ſhot, withall, crying out like mad men, but in the end they knew each other, and perceiuing where they were, their reſiſtance turned into feare, and diſlodged themſelues without any trumpet.</p>
               <p>Theſe two armies hauing ſomewhat breathed themſelues, for the ſpace of a the Prince marched towards <hi>Mirebeau,</hi> which he tooke, and the duke retired to <hi>Poictiers:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe of the Admirall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Briſſacks Regiment.</note> each of them lodging ſomewhat more at large to reſt their wearied troupes. Withing 8. or
10. daies the Admirall deuiſed an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, wherby to cut off Countie
<hi>Briſſacks</hi> Regiment, which was wel lodged and blocked vp at
<hi>Ances,</hi> a village within one league of <hi>Poictiers.</hi> Now hee imagined that all the Dukes auantgard had ſtil lodged in that ſubburb of the towne that led to the ſaid village: but indeed more then the one halfe was paſſed ouer the water the day before, onely the Switzers and ſome few horſe ſtayed behind: and therefore he brought with him 6000. Harquebuſiers, and 1500. horſe, that by break of day came to the village, and after ſome ſmal reſiſtance forced it. The Regiment, with the loſſe of fiftie or ſixtie men, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it ſelfe, by the fauour of a ſmall valley in the campe, where they found but ſmall ſupport: how be it they ſet ſo good a face of the matter vpon a banke with their varlets, that the Admirall, who could not take any certaine view of them, and was loath to hazard any thing, left them, and carried away the moſt part of their carriages. The two armies after ſo me ſmall reſt, fell to their former reſolution of fighting. The Duke taking the field, recouered <hi>Mirc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>au,</hi> where couenants were but ſlenderly kept, for after the yeelding of it, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ſouldiers, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to promiſe were ſlaine: whervpon <hi>Andelot</hi> ſoone after, taking the Abbey of S. <hi>Florent</hi> neare <hi>Saumur,</hi> put the whole Garriſon to the ſword. The Duke meaning to come nearer to the Prince, tooke vp his lodgings about <hi>Monſtrueil-Bellay</hi> and <hi>Thouers,</hi> for the better commoditie of victuals. Here he was aduiſed, that it was not amiſſe to ſeize vpon the towne of <hi>Loudun,</hi> which lay in his way, &amp; was kept by one of the Princes regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, to the end there to lodge his armie, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bear himſelf according as things might fall out: for by keeping of that, he ſhould cut off his enemies from a plentifull countrie, able to feed his armie for one month. The Prince confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering this deuiſe, rather then to take ſuch a ſcorne, as to ſee one of his regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cut off before his face, and ſo by looſing a Towne able to hold out,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:22081:103"/>to prooue himſelf either faint-harted, or too feeble, reſolued to march night and day towards <hi>Lodun,</hi> and ſo at his comming quartered all his footemen in the ſubburbes, fiue or ſixe hundreth horſe in the towne, and the reſt in the next villages. The Dukes armie the night before, had incamped within a ſmall French league of the place, in part, weening that the Prince would not obſtinately aduenture his forces for the obſeruation of ſo meane a place: but the next day the D. vnderſtood that the Princes armie fell into battell array along the ſubburbes, wherevpon he cauſed his men to do the like: and the artillerie on both ſides began to play euen into the ſquadrons, and ſometimes not in vaine. There might a man haue ſeene aboue 4000. men, almoſt all French, in battell array, not far aſunder, as fierce in courage, as gallant in countenance, who for the moſt part did all expect onely the watch word to fight. There was between both the armies onely a plaine field, without any aduantage, which might cauſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to maruel, that for foure daies ſpace, both the armies lying in ſight, and within cannon ſhot each of other, they neuer came to handy blowes, neither to any skirmiſh of importance, and that but ſeldome in reſpect of other times. But the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are to remember, that ther was not ſo ſharpe a winter in
20. yeares before,<note place="margin">The colde kept the Frenchmen from killing one another.</note> becauſe that as it was a moſt hard froſt, ſo the ſleete that fell continually made it ſo ſlipperie, hat the footemen were not able to ſtand on their legs: yet much more dangerous was it for the horſes, neither could a horſe get ouer a bancke three foote high, ſo ſlippery was the grownd. Many ſuch bancks there were between the two armies, which had bin caſt as partitions of mens lands, which were euen ſo many trenches, wherby he that would haue giuen the firſt onſet, muſt needs haue been diſordered: and that was the cauſe that each ſtood faſt, looking vppon other, to ſee which ſide would ſo vnaduiſedly aduenture the hazerd. Thus they ſtood ſtraining of courteſie and this firſt day there fell out onely ſome ſmall skirmiſhes, whervpon all the troupes an houre before night retired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their quarters. The next day the armies ſet themſelues again in battell, and ſaluted each other with cannon ſhot: ſome there were that as the day before went out to skirmiſh, but they either brake or vnioynted their armes or legges, ſo as there were more hurt ſo, then by the ſmall ſhot. The third day they did the like, but could neuer find any means to ioyne without incurring great inconueniences. The fourth day the D. whoſe men for the moſt part lay in the open fields, retired a league off, to warm his troupes that were ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with colde, &amp; in his retrait loſt three companies, one of Switzers, and two of Frenchmen, that were ſurpriſed in a village: within a while after, the ſouldiers fell into ſuch vehement and greeuous diſeaſes, that in one moneth there periſhed on both ſides ſome 8000. men, notwithſtanding through the preſence of their Generals, and their owne earneſt deſire to fight, they were content to beare all: but the Dukes men had the woorſt, as they that were not ſo wel prouided either in lodgings or victuals, as their aduerſaties. Some cornets of horſemen of both ſides, were lodged ſome halfe league or three quarters aſunder, but in the euening returning to their lodgings, they were ſo benummed with colde, that they made no great haſte to moleſt their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, no not ſo much as with one alarme, as if they had been at truce.<note place="margin">The gallant enterpriſe of the Admirall againſt the Dukes army</note>

               <p>The next day after this departure, the Admirall imagining that the Dukes men, who not long before were lodged halfe vnder the hedge, after they were gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a little way off, wold ſcatter into the good towns (as indeed <pb n="206" facs="tcp:22081:104"/>they did, leauing in the bodie of their armie three or foure hundreth horſe, and about twelue hundreth ſhot, the reſt beeing gone a league or two off) about nine of clocke in the morning, when the Princes horſe were come in, brought foorth twelue or fourteen thouſand ſhot, &amp; 4. field peeces, in full purpoſe to make to the dukes maine armie, which was not paſt a league and a halfe off. The Captaines knew of a brooke that was betweene, with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine foords, as their guides reported, not very daungerous. The night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hauing taken the view, and tryed the guards, they found them force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: but the Princes ſhot co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to the foord, which was within a quarter of a league of the Dukes armie, found it furniſhed with footemen, whom they did couragiouſly aſſault, but could not force. Herevpon the campe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a hot alarme, ſhot off their ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nons to call in their ſcattered troups, and as they came, ſent ſupplies to keepe the paſſage: but within a quarter of an houre after, the Admirall ſet vpon another place, which was ſtoutly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and had they not ſtood faſt there, the Duke had beene quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. For before a thouſand men could come in, the Admiral had broght 1500. horſe, and 6000. ſhot, that would haue ſhaken them ſhrewdly. Some two hours after, by that the D. had gathered almoſt all his troupes, and ſent ſome pecees on vnto a little banke, after ſome volees on either ſide, thy could driue euery man away. On both ſides, as well the gentrie as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſouldiers, murmured mightily againſt their leaders, for that to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they brought them foorth into moſt extreame froſts and colde, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining alſo, that they were in maner beſieged with hunger and famine, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding withal, that vnleſſe they might bee better prouided and fenced in place of ſafetie, themſelues would go and lodge as they thought good, as beeing vnable any longer to indure ſuch extremities. In this ſuite they found no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction: for their leaders were ſoon inclined to yeeld to their deſire. The Duke went to winter beyond
<hi>Loire,</hi> about <hi>Saumur:</hi> &amp; the Prince at <hi>Thouers, Monstrueil-Bellay,</hi> and thereabout. Thus did the colde ſcatter thoſe that it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to be doing, and ſought all opportunitie to fight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Timoleon de Coſſe,</hi> Countie <hi>de Briſſac,</hi> a young Lord, couragious, and for his yeares very wiſe,<note place="margin">The gallant enterpriſe of the Countie Briſſac, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Admiral and his brother d'Andelot.</note> but carried away with an exceſsiue deſire to ſhewe his valour: and withall, hardened on by the Duke of <hi>Anious</hi> fauour, who among all other made moſt of him: vndertooke a gallant enterpriſe, which albeit it had no great ſucceſſe, doth notwithſtanding deſerue to be knowne. The Admirall and his brother, with their cornets, were lodged in the towne of <hi>Monſtrueil-Bellay.</hi> Hard at hand in a little ſubburbe, laye two companies of footmen, as ſimple guards both to their lodgings &amp; the goods. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men did no more but walke their rounds at the ordinary houres about the walles, which they thought to bee ſufficient, for by reaſon that vppon the high-way from
<hi>Saumur,</hi> in a great ſubburbe beyond the riuer, their lay ſixe or ſeuen Regiments of footemen, <hi>Monſtrueil</hi> was on that ſide ſufficiently ſafe: On the other ſide, for the ſpace of one whole league, there were great fens, not paſſeable but in ſome few places: alſo 9. or 10. cornets of horſe lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the villages round about, that night and day lay bearing of the waies. Al theſe helpes made it ſo ſtrong, as there was ſmall apparance that it ſhould incur any perill.

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:22081:104"/>the Countie was informed of the ſmall guard at
<hi>Monſtrueil.</hi> Next, that by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two leagues about from the bare high way, hee might get thither with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger of the Admirals ſtrength or guard of the horſe: which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he would not aduenture, vntill for his more aſſurance; he had ſent a French Captaine and an Italian, in the euening to take a view: theſe men went vnto the wall, &amp; with a long pike, a cord, and an Iron hooke, they got vp, (for the walles were not high) &amp; ſo came to the Admirals lodging about nine of the clocke at night, and then returned againe vneſpied: as one of them ſince reported to the Lord
<hi>de la Noue,</hi> who was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at <hi>Monſtrueil</hi> with the Admiral.

Thus ſhuld he take two notable Captaines in the middeſt of their aſſurance, and at the leaſt
100. Gentlemen of name: beſides, he ſhuld vtterly breake the whole auantgard, lodged therabout, which would neuer haue ſtood the comming of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, ſo great would the confuſion haue beene, beſides ſundrie other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences that might haue enſued. I haue heard the Lord <hi>de la Noue,</hi> from whom I haue heard this report, which himſelfe hath put into his diſcourſes, who was then as I ſaid, with the Admiral, ſay that
<hi>Briſſac</hi> might haue atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this enterpriſe: but as we are to pray to god to watch ouer ſuch as ſleep, and the conſeruation of their fates: ſo as the Countie was vppon the way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the performance of his purpoſe, a ſmall chance croſſed, yea vtterly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted all his deuiſes. For comming with a dozen of lathers, and his men ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reolute, being within two leagues of the place, hee met with 200. of the enemies horſe: who ſeeing this ſmall armie at that time of night in the field, retired in haſt, and raiſed an alarme at <hi>Monſtrueil</hi> and other places thereabout, where their horſemen were lodged, whervpon the Countie was driuen to retire: afterward the Admirall ſtrengthened his night watches better, &amp; beat the fields more often, yet neuer could finde any newes of the enterpriſe, or know how it was vntill the next peace.

               <p>But about the end of February, the Prince began to gather his armie, report beeing giuen out, that the Duke was alreadie in field, and marched with all his forces to <hi>Angouleſme.</hi>

There hee had a light skirmiſh with certaine troupes, that had paſſed in certaine barkes, or ouer certaine plankes ſpeedily caſt ouer. The Admirall thinking that the Duke would paſſe ouer, and thinking to haue time to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe the Prince to prouide for him, minded to ſtop that paſſage, vntill the next day. And appoynted two Regiments of foote to lodge within a quarter of a myle from the bridge, and eight hundreth horſe ſomewhat further off, wherof the third part ſhould keepe watch hard by it, as well to aduertiſe, as to offer fight: which done, hee withdrew himſelfe to <hi>Baſſac,</hi> about a league fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bridge: with <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> reſt of the vantgard, the Prince came to <hi>Iarnac,</hi> which lyeth a league further: but this commandement was not executed. For both the horſe and foote, knowing that in the places appoynted them to ſtaye, there was but fewe houſes, with leſſe victuals and fourage, hauing wholly forgotten how to incampe themſelues, &amp; to be without commoditie in their lodgings, went to finde ſome other quarter. Whereby the moſt part of this troupe left that place, to lodge themſelues with more eaſe, &amp; left but a ſmall number of men in place, that laye about halfe a league from it. This great fault produced another: which was, that the watch was too weake,<note place="margin">A notable fault.</note> which could not come time ynough to hear, nor giue alarme to the enemies troups, as they had beene inſtructed, thereby to make them thinke, that all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Auantgard lay there. The Dukes armie beeing very ſtrong, reſolued to ſeize vpon the paſſage, although all the Princes power had oppoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt him, and by the diligence of
<hi>Monſieur de Biron,</hi> not onely repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the bridge, but made a new bridge of barkes, which are carried with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies royall, and before midnight had finiſhed it: which done, without great noyſe they began to paſſe ouer, both horſe and foote. The Princes men, that ſtood in gard with fiftie horſe, about a ſmall quarter of a league from the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, in a manner could ſcarce perceiue them to paſſe, vntill about the breake of day, wherewith they preſently aduertiſed the Admirall, who knowing that moſt part of his men had lodged in other places, namely, on that ſide where the enemies came, ſent them word that they paſſed, and with all ſpeed to march towards him, that they might retire altogither, &amp; that in the meane time, hee would ſtay for them at <hi>Baſſac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the ſame time alſo, hee commaunded, that all the carriage and footmen ſhould retire: which was preſently done.

The Admirall would not looſe thoſe troupes, being nine Cornets of horſe, and certaine companies of foot, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Coronels were the Counte <hi>Montgommery, Acier,</hi> and <hi>Puuiaut.</hi> Beeing all come, onely <hi>Acier,</hi> that tooke the way towards <hi>Angouleſme,</hi> all the Dukes armie beeing paſt, and hard by the Admirall, the skirmiſh began ſo hot, that

               <p>The kings Councell finding themſelues to ſeeke, did ſpeedily conclude of a ſmall armie, vnder the leading of the Duke of

               <p>They were reſoluted not to linger vntill hee entered

               <p>The Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> hath ſince ſundrie times reported, that he maruelled that in ſo long and difficult a paſſage, the Romiſh Catholiques could neuer finde fit opportunitie, conſidering that many occaſions befell them, and the rather by reaſon of the impeachments of their maine carriages. For beſides theſe great forces of the Dukes of
<hi>Aumale</hi> and <hi>Nemours,</hi> the townes, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and riuers, were at their commaund: they alſo knewe the purpoſes of their aduerſe armie, which conſiſted in making haſte, and either by force or ſurpriſe winning paſſage ouer <hi>Loyre,</hi> whither it came maugre all their polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and deuiſes. It was ſaid, that through ſome contention between them, they loſt ſundrie good exployts which they ought haue performed, had they beene at vnion: beſides, they doubted the vigilancie of
<hi>Moruilliers:</hi> the induſtrie of <hi>Feuguieres:</hi> and the readineſſe and valiancie of <hi>Nouy, Esternay,</hi> and other Captaines, who held them in continuall alarme: and had not the news of the battell at
<hi>Baſſac</hi> comforted them, <hi>Aumale</hi> and <hi>Nemours</hi> had been either defeated or forced to licence their troupes, and ſo to retire into the townes.</p>
               <p>If fell out well for the Germaines that they made ſuch haſte: for this great blocke, this riuer of <hi>Loire,</hi> would haue been a ſecond and moſt gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous difficultie to ſtay theſe riuers, as well for that it was not ſo ſhallow, as to yeeld any foord: as alſo for that all the townes ſtanding therevppon were enemies, yet was the paſſage ſo neceſſary, that it made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vſe great ſpeed, courage, and inuention: for contrary to all expectation of their enemies on each ſide the riuer, they aſſaulted a towne called <hi>la Charitee,</hi> where they had a good bridge.</p>
               <p>Among al the ouerſights of the Rom. Catholicques, who were reenforced with a ſupply of Italians from the Pope, of twelue hundreth horſe, and four thouſand foote, this was not the leaſt, that they left
<hi>la Charitee</hi> deſtitute of men: wherevppon the Proteſtants lay ſo hard to that place, and terrified it with ſo many mines and threats, that before it could haue any reliefe, they had wonne it to their incredible ioy: which neuertheleſſe was abated by the deceaſe of <hi>Feuquieres</hi> and other Captaines poyſoned by the way, according vnto <hi>Biragues</hi> precepts.</p>
               <p>Had it not been for this prize, the Germaine armie had bin hard beſtead, <pb n="214" facs="tcp:22081:108"/>and their leaders forced to haue returned backe to the head of <hi>Loire,</hi> which was ſixtie leagues off: yea, which was woorſe, taking that courſe, they ſhould haue intangled themſelues in a hilly &amp; wood countrie, where their horſe would haue been but a hinderance.</p>
               <p>The Admirall accounted this paſſage impoſsible, and ſtill harkened af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their ouerthrow,<note place="margin">The Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals opinion touching the paſſage of the Rutters.</note> many times telling his familiars that he could not helpe this ſuccor, in regard that the Duke of

               <p>The Princes with their troupes marched immediately towards
<hi>Limo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin,</hi> that ſo they might come nearer to the Duke of
<hi>Anious</hi> power to keepe it in awe, albeit in continuall feare, ſtill looking to heare that al the enemies ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies beeing ſo ſtrong, ſhould haue ſwallowed vp their Rutters: which fell out contrary: for they tooke ſo good opportunitie, and vſed ſuch ſpeed, that they out went them, vnder the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duct of the French troupes, where among the reſt, <hi>Nouy</hi> bare himſelfe more valiantly in ſundrie roades of the enemies, whom diuers times he ſent backe, &amp; gathered to the place where the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall had appoynted to meet them with one thouſand ſhot, and two thouſand and fiue hundreth horſe.</p>

               <p>The Duke <hi>d'Aniou</hi> conſidering how much the paſſage imported, which the Princes had gotten vpon the riuer of <hi>Loire</hi> at
<hi>la Charitee,</hi> not much fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſince the taking, reſolued to take that place from them,<note place="margin">The ſiege of la Charitee by Lanſac, and the iſſue.</note> which was well aduiſed, for that winning it, hee ſhould bereaue them of all meanes to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt the Prouinces on this ſide the riuer of <hi>Loire,</hi> and reſerue vnto himſelfe the ſinues of the warres, with infinite commodities for the refreſhing of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. But in ſtead of marching thither, in all diligence after the paſſage of the Rutters, he contented himſelfe to command <hi>M. de Lanſac</hi> to take order ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Hee neuer hauing had any commiſsion of ſuch importance, thought that by ſtrength of men and cannon ſhot, he would do ſomething. And vpon the ſixt of Iuly accompanied with 7000. footemen, aſſembled out of the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of <hi>Orleans, Bourges, Chartres, Neuers, Gyan,</hi> and other Townes. With fiue or ſixe hundreth horſe he beſieged <hi>la Charitee,</hi> charged and recharged his batterie three or foure times, ſparing neither powder nor bullet: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made a breach to enter both with horſe and waggons, he commanded his ſouldiers to giue an aſſault, who beeing men vſed to braue it in the ſtreets of a Towne, and to diſcharge their peeces in the preſence of Ladies: when they perceiued that the beſieged reſolued themſelues to a ſtout and bold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, their hearts were turned to lyuers, ſo that their Captaines, Enſignes, Sergeants, and other officers, were forced to ſupply their places, of 100. of them: there returned fiue againe, but all ouerthrowne at the entrie of the breach. An other thing was, that a falſe report ranne in the campe of <hi>Lanſac,</hi> that the Princes armie came to ayde <hi>la Charitee,</hi> and that Captaine
<hi>Bloſſet</hi> was alreadie in <hi>Berry</hi> with 200. horſe, to marke out their lodgings, &amp; to giue the firſt charge: wherewith the aſſailants made ſuch an alarme, that without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inquirie, they ſpied their Enſignes marching day &amp; night, to neſtle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their Garriſons. The ſiege continued almoſt a month, where, &amp; in the retrait, the aſſailants loſt almoſt 1000. men: the town about 100. &amp; being deliuered from this ſiege, and not long after ſtrengthened by the companies of <hi>Bloſſet, Boys,</hi> and others, that had left the campe to viſit their houſes, and to refreſh themſelues: the leaders made account to fourage the countrie, and to ſeeke aduentures farre and neare. With this reſolution they tooke <hi>Douzi, Pouilli, Antrain, S.

<hi>Poictiers,</hi> the great helps that they had for their defence: their own ſmal ſtore of artillery, muniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; powers to giue their aſſault, with many other their diſcommodities.

               <p>The ſiege hauing continued ſome few weekes, ſundrie breaches being made with ſome aſſaults, skirmiſhes, and ſallies: laſtly, neceſitie ſet vppon the beſieged, and ſickneſſe, togither with want of munition, the beſiegers, whereby their troupes were driuen by little and little to breake: the beſieged had loſt diuers of their beſt Captaines, and a number of ſouldiers, and their neceſsitie grew to ſuch a famine, that aſſes and horſes grew to be good meat.

But this reſolution of the Duke ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued well for the Princes, as beeing a good occaſion for them to leaue the ſiege, which notwithſtanding they had done, not hauing means to ſtay any longer before it.

               <p>The Admirall running to that diſorder, ſhewed himſelfe vnto his men, and reaſſembled them in ſuch ſort, that at his comming were giuen two or three great charges and recharges, of fifteene hundreth or two thouſand horſes at once, and ſuch as paſſed, were ſoone driuen backe againe by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

The two armies placed themſelues in battell, one heere, the other there, about a long musket ſhot diſtant from each other, that of the Princes, beeing ſoone vnder couert: to paſſe that place, no man durſt be ſo bold, for the danger that might enſue, becauſe diuers ſquadrons would ſoone haue ſpoyled ſuch as had ventured.

               </p>
               <p>Before the battell, two Gentlemen bearing armes in the Dukes campe, beeing ſtrayed, came to ſome of thoſe of thereligion,<note place="margin">Notable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſement neglected.</note> hauing certaine ditches betweene them, and hauing proteſted vnto them, that they bare no malice vnto the Princes, willed them to aduertiſe the Admirall to keepe his armie from fighting, becauſe the Dukes armie was very ſtrong, by reaſon of new ſtrength, but that hee ſhould driue off the time for the ſpace of a moneth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the Nobilitie had proteſted, not to ſtay any longer, but that if they were imployed within that time, they would doo their beſt to aduance his ſeruice. That it was daungerous to ſtriue againſt the French furie, which in ſhort time would be abated, and by that meanes the Duke with his Councell ſhould bee conſtrained to ſeeke for peace, and to graunt it with aduantage to thoſe of the religion: which aduertiſment giuen, thoſe two Gentlemen reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of the religion went preſently to the Admirall, to certifie him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which counſell liked him well. They ſhewed it likewiſe to others of the principall commaunders, whereof ſome reiected it not, and deſired it might bee followed: but the greateſt part eſteemed it to be but an artificial deuiſe to put them in feare, adding, that although this aduiſe ſeemed to bee good, yet it was not to be accounted of, becauſe it proceeded from ſuſpect perſons, and ſuch as vſually exerciſe deceits: commonly ſuch as are neare to any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, deſpiſe the good counſell wherewith men ſeeke to relieue them. The Princes Councell aſſembling to reſolue vpon their proceedings, ſome ſayd it was beſt for them to get to <hi>Ernaux,</hi> and to ſet the riuer which runneth by it,<note place="margin">Euill coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell followed.</note> between both the armies, and to depart about nine of the clocke in the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and to march all night, that they might get thither in ſafetie, becauſe the Duke was at hand. Others replyed, that thoſe nightly retraits, put feare into ſuch as make them, imbaſing their reputations, giuing courage to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and that it were beſt to depart about the breake of day. This ſecond aduiſe, (beeing the woorſt) was followed.</p>
               <p>The Admirall as then was in great diſtruſt, fearing that the Rutters would mutin for want of pay, and that three or foure of his Regiments of far coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries would leaue him: becauſe they had alreadie asked him licence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</p>
               <p>He knew likewiſe that diuers Gentlemen were retired vnto their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, wherefore to hold the armie in vnitie, hee beſought the Princes (that were at <hi>Partenay</hi>) to come thither: which they did, bringing with them one hundreth and fiftie good horſe. The next day in the morning, the horſemen were readie mounted to ryde to <hi>Ernaux,</hi> all in white caſſockes, the better to know them, if they ſhould bee forced to fight.

               <p>And hauing marched a quarter of a league, they diſcouered the Dukes armie, aduancing it ſelfe in ſuch manner, that all the leiſure they had, was to range themſelues in order, and to place themſelues in a valley, in couert from the cannon ſhot. After this enſued an other miſchiefe in the Princes armie, which was, that the Admirall perceiuing the Dukes vantgard to ſet forward, (wherein was nineteene cornets of Rutters in two ſquadrons) and to come right vpon him, hee ſent to the Countie <hi>Lodowicke</hi> that commaunded the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, that he ſhould ſend him three cornets of horſe: which the Countie did, but hee himſelfe led them, and at that inſtant beganne the battell, hee remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in fight: whereby the bodie of the battell remained without a head, not knowing how to gouerne it ſelfe: &amp; it is thought, that if the Countie (a wiſe and valiant Gentleman) had beene there, the body of the battell had mades good reſiſtance,<note place="margin">The body of the battell without a head.</note> ſeeing that being ſo diſcouered, it had almoſt put the dukes battell to fight.</p>

<hi>Partenay,</hi> where they arriued about tenne of the clocke at night, fiue houres after the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, where the reſt likewiſe came.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Conſultation in the Dukes councel, what was to be don after the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel of Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contour.</note>Immediately after this victorie, the chiefe Leaders of the Dukes armie were aſſembled to debate what was beſt to bee done: the opinions were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and the woorſt followed. Some alleadged, that ſince the Princes foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were quite ouerthrowne, and that they had fewe horſemen but Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who were alreadie wonderful diſcontent for the loſſe of their baggage, the beſt courſe would be with all ſpeed to follow them, ſo ſhould they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe one of theſe two effects, either vtterly ouerthrow them, or force them to compound for their retraict into <hi>Germanie,</hi> which might eaſily be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, by giuing them ſome two moneths pay.</p>
               <p>Heereto adding, that the Admirall a wary Captaine, and one that knewe how to ſhift out of the bryers, had hee but euen very ſmall leiſure, would repaire his forces, adding ſome replies out of
<hi>Gaſcon</hi> and <hi>Languedoc:</hi> ſo that in the ſpring, they ſhould be aſſured to haue him in the field with a new armie, wherewith hee would waſte ſundrie Prouinces, and tranſport the wars euen to the Gates of <hi>Parris.</hi> Beſides, the preſence of the Princes among their daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted troupes, would by little and little harten them againe, and ſtirre vppe the ſtomacks of many others that were now quailed in other places, vnleſſe with diligence they were abridged from making profit of the time. In ſumme, they concluded that the Duke with the two thirds of his armie, ſhuld follow the Princes, whereby vndoubtedly he ſhould driue their leaders for refuge to ſhut vp themſelues in ſome weake place, whereby the warres might bee ended.</p>
               <p>Others thought it better to reape the aſſured fruite of the victorie, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the townes that were holden in the Princes names, which in this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment might eaſily bee done, but would heereafter bee harder, and in maner impoſsible, in caſe they had reſpite to ſuruay their own eſtates, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by there would be new ſtirres: for the Proteſtants would neuer be ſubdued, ſo long as they had any places of retrait: but once ſhutte out of their ſtarting holes, they would haue no great ſtomacke to bee buſie. That their townes that were to be taken in
<hi>Poictou, Xaintongue,</hi> and <hi>Angoulmois,</hi> were not to hold out any long time againſt a victorious armie, ſo mightie, and euery day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing: alſo that ſo <hi>Rochel</hi> ſeeing her ſelfe left poſt alone and open to them, would ſoone quake: as for the remainders of the defeated armie, or that the Admirall and Princes were gotten into ſafetie, all that would waſte of it ſelfe: and for the haſting of the execution therof, they might ſend after them ſome one thouſand horſe, and two thouſand ſhot: and withall, raiſe the whole po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Prouinces where they ſhould ſtay. In the meane time with all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition to ſend for artillerie and munititon to performe this purpoſe, which beeing atchieued, would inflict a mortall wound vppon thoſe of the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who alreadie halted of the one legge.</p>
               <p>This latter aduiſe tooke place, yet but in part neither, namely, ſo farre as <pb n="224" facs="tcp:22081:113"/>concerned the taking of townes, yet not of all: but as for purſuing of the Princes, the Duke and his Councell neuer thought more of it, but imployed their time in that which ſeemed moſt eaſie. The Admirall did ſince report to the Lord <hi>de la Noue,</hi> that had they chearefully purſued the Princes and him, when they tranſported the remainders of their armie into <hi>Gaſcon,</hi> they had vtterly indaungered them, conſidering that paſsing through the countrie of <hi>Perigort,</hi> and other ſtraights, the Peſants and pettie Garriſons wrought them much trouble, by reaſon they had none but horſemen, and thoſe in part tired, and in part aſtoniſhed: but there ſort that they had to refreſh themſelues, to ſtrengthen their power with footemen, and to gather in the booties of the good countrie as they went, reſtored their courages, and put them in newe hopes.</p>
               <p>The Princes hauing reaſſembled their forces after the battell of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contour,</hi> and taken ſpeedie aduiſe in

               <p>Fiue daies after, the Queene brought the king her ſonne, as then of the age of nineteene yeares, with a great traine vnto the ſiege, to the ende, that he might likewiſe haue part of the honor of ſo many conqueſts in his realm, and againſt his owne ſubiects. But not long after, hee could well complaine that his mother had brought him thither to drinke of the ſhame, and to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour the Duke of <hi>Aniou</hi> her other ſonne, whom ſhe ſought to aduance. It was thought as then, the beſieged would haue yeelded themſelues within two daies after: but thoſe two daies continued aboue ſixe weekes. Captaine <hi>la Ramiere</hi> was ſo ſore hurt at the beginning of the batterie, that hee died not long after, much lamented by thoſe of the towne, for his valour and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <p>During this batterie, <hi>la Motte Puiols,</hi> and <hi>S.

The beſieged retired with two Enſignes, many dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes &amp; weapons, &amp; great bootie, without loſſe of any one man. Afterward the furie of the cannon was redoubled, and the beſiegers reſolued to abide, but not to fight but with cannon ſhot.</p>
               <p>Finally the ſiege hauing continued for the ſpace of two monethes, there was a capitulation ſigned with the kings owne hand, importing, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged ſhould iſſue out, with their goods, armes, and horſes, their Enſignes wound vp, and that for the ſpace of foure monethes after, they ſhould not beare armes for the generall cauſe of the religion, that as well ſtraungers as others, might retire whither they would, with all ſecuritie: and that they ſhould be conducted by
<hi>Biron</hi> &amp; <hi>Coſſeins.</hi> Now it remained that they ſhould prouide to depart the next day, being the third of Decemb. which they did euery man as well as hee might. In the meane time, the ſicke and wounded, the aged, impotent, and women, tooke on mightily, neither was there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nything heard, but weeping and lamentation, eſpecially at the departure, which was about noone.

Beeing come to the midſt of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs, the Romiſh Catholicqueſouldiers began to diſcharge vppon thereſt, and with force draue them into their lodgings, where they ſtripped them of their armes, apparrel, and mony: the marſhal being hereof aduertiſed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to follow him with their weapons readie, but as he ran one way, there was much iniurie offered an other.

Indeede ſome fewe of the verieſt raſcals and treachers were banniſhed the campe, and recompence promiſed for the loft baggage: beſides that, the king ſeemed to be mightily diſcontent, that his name ſhuld be ſo villainouſly prophaned: but this ſecond promiſe was as well obſerued as the firſt.</p>

The kings armie by want of victuals and other diſcommodities, preſently after, went from Saint <hi>Iohn de Angely,</hi> leauing the Princes and the Admirall to thinke vpon their voyage.

               <p>The King,<note place="margin">1570.</note> the Queene, the Duke of

And according to this aduiſe in the moneth of Nouember, 1569. a meeting was practiſed betweene the Marſhall <hi>de Coſſe,</hi> and the Deputies of the Queene of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> the Deputies hauing preſented their articles, although the matter ought rather to bee handled by conference then by writings, which haue no replies, the meanes therein vſed, and the delaies practiſed for aunſwering therevnto, made the Princes know and perceiue, that their enemiesment to helpe themſelues by that deuice to hinder their affaires.</p>
               <p>After the firſt audience giuen vnto their Deputies, they were giuen to vnderſtand, that the king could not indure the exerciſe of their religion, and that they ought to content the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with the libertie of their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. An other deuice was wrought, which was, that meſſengers were ſent into <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Almaine,</hi> to certifie them that the peace was made: by that meanes to ſtay the ayde that they might procure from thence. And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, Poſtes went in all haſte to procure money and forraine ſouldiers. They diſcouered diuers practiſes againſt them, both within &amp; without the Realme, the effect beeing, that firſt they would diſarme them, and then vſe them and all thoſe of the religion, as the iudgement giuen againſt the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſufficiently ſhewed.

               <p>After the battel of <hi>Moncontour,</hi> we ſee how the forces of the Proteſtants were ſcattered in diuers Prouinces.

The Councel weening to terrifie the L. of

               <p>Theſe freſh ſprings of the <hi>Rochelers</hi> procured the ſending of <hi>Puigaillard,</hi> with fourteen companies of the ordenances, &amp; ninteen Enſignes of footme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to warre vvpon them. <hi>Fernaques,</hi> who lay in <hi>Fontenay</hi> with ſeuen ſcore ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, made an enterpriſe againſt <hi>Langon,</hi> and the foord of <hi>Velugre,</hi> which hee wonne, taking at the foord thirtie priſoners, &amp; killing eight ſouldiers which coſt him fifteene of his. The taking of this place, with the loſſe of <hi>Lucon,</hi> did greatly annoy <hi>Marans</hi> and

For thoſe of the religion, perceiuing that they ſought onely to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and deſtroy them, determined to proceed, and to make of neceſsitie a vertue. And as time breedeth changes, thoſe that happened were to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages, in ſuch ſort, that their courages were increaſed, and their hopes fortified.</p>
               <p>The king, the Queen, and their Councell, perceiuing that ſince the loſſe receiued before Saint <hi>Iohn d'Angely,</hi> they found themſelues new to beginne, determined to beginne a parley of peace: wherein for their part, <hi>Biron</hi> was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, with charge (as like wiſe

The king was greeued that the continuance of warre bereaued him of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, ouerthrew the loue and obedience due vnto him, fouraged his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, diminiſhed his treaſures, and conſumed his forces.

The Queen his mother was much offended, becauſe that from the beginning of the firſt troubles, it was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered that her intents were to rule, and to cauſe the one part to ſpoyle the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Her chiefe obiect beeing wholly againſt thoſe of the religion, ſpecially againſt the Admirall and other commaunders. There was too much paine and daunger to bring them to her bow by dint of ſword: murtherers and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyſoners durſt hardly approach, the Princes applyed themſelues to the time, and from their youths beganne to know the friends and enemies of reſt and quietneſſe of

               <p>On the other ſide, the Queen of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and the Admirall, as alſo diuers great Lords of their part, affected to the good of the Common-wealth, and foreſeeing that the ingrafted enemies thereof, deſired nothing but the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſame, by the meanes of ciuill warres, there to erect their practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and to open the way to their ambitious deuiſes, deſired by an aſſured peace to ſee ſome end of the miſeries of <hi>France:</hi> hoping that mens mindes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat cooled, good counſell would bee taken for the benefit of the Common-wealth, to the vtter confuſion of the ſecret and open enemies thereof: the diuine prouidence of the almightie God and ruler of the world, directeth our affaires partly according to our deſires, but for the moſt part, it guideth all things in ſuch manner, that calling to mind that which paſt after, vntill the death of the Duke of <hi>Aniou,</hi> which was <hi>Henry</hi> the third, wee cannot marke nor ſay otherwiſe, but that the iudgements of God are vnſearchable, and that his waies are impoſsible to bee found out.</p>

                  <hi>Puuiaut</hi> beeing at Saint <hi>Gemme,</hi> ſuſpecting the matter, finding that the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petter could not wel keep his countenance,<note place="margin">Puigallards diſsimulation diſcouered.</note> layd hold of him, and ſo forced him to confeſſe the trueth.

               <p>Soone after that, <hi>Puuiaut</hi> and all his men, were departed out of S. <hi>Gemme</hi> to ioyne with <hi>la Noue: Puigaillards</hi> footmen approached, aſſaulted the barriers, &amp; without reſiſtance entered into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> borough, but finding no bodie, ſome fell to ſleeping, ſome to feeding, &amp; ſome ran to tell <hi>Puigaillard</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the enemies fled: he thinking neuer to come time ynogh, entered Saint

               <p>The territorie betweene Saint <hi>Gemme</hi> and <hi>Lucon</hi> is a vine ground, well fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with hedge and ditch, with ſome fields diuided with a high-way of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable bredth,<note place="margin">The batiell of Lucon, where Puigaillard loſt his foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> on each ſide beſet with buſhes. <hi>La Noue</hi> came firſt, and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded well for his troupes: <hi>Puigaillard</hi> could not haue any ſuch aduantage, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in regard of his horſemen, which by reaſon of ditches were forced to come on a row: this beeing conſidered by Captaine <hi>Stephen,</hi> a leader of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſallets and ſome ſhot, backed with twentie horſe, vnder the conduct of <hi>Bruneliere,</hi> he beganne the charge by <hi>la Noues</hi> appoyntment, and valiantly ſet vpon the firſt troupes of
<hi>Puigaillards</hi> horſemen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Puuiaut</hi> perceiuing them on euery ſide to ſtagger, who were ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth and fiftie Maiſters, hee brake into them, killed ſome, feared the reſt, who fell vpon their owne footemen, and fledde with
<hi>Puigallard</hi> as faſt as the horſe might driue to <hi>Fontenay,</hi> which was foure leagues of: &amp; ſuch as were but badly horſed, were beaten downe and preſently ſlaine.</p>
               <p>Then were their footemen on euery ſide beſet, and beeing in the plaine field, drawing toward the buſhes, they were beaten downe with ſhot, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would the horſemen let them runne farre, but cut them in peeces: but of all other, the Launſquenets ſhewed moſt crueltie, obiecting to the Kings guard the battell of <hi>Moncontour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had it not beene for <hi>la Noue</hi> and <hi>Soubize,</hi> all
<hi>Puigaillards</hi> footemen hadde beene quite rooted out, ſo ſore were the Launſquenets bent againſt them.

               <p>

<hi>Obiron, Marens, Soubize,</hi> and <hi>Brouage,</hi> where <hi>Riuiere Puitaille,</hi> one of their chiefe Captaines, was ſo wounded, that hee died immediately. To be briefe, the Proteſtants tooke from them all that they held about <hi>Rochel,</hi> excrept Saint <hi>Iohn d'Angely,</hi> where they neſtled themſelues.</p>
               <p>The Barron <hi>de la Garde</hi> had for a while kept the ſea with his Gallies, but hearing of the taking of <hi>Bronage,</hi> hee retired toward <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> whileſt <hi>Sore</hi> for the Princes ſcoured the <hi>Ocean,</hi> where hee daily light vppon ſome bootie. Among other his exployts, about the beginning of Iuly hee tooke a Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall ſhippe, laden among other marchandize with ſome fortie Ieſuites, that were trauelling toward <hi>India,</hi> but they were ſtayed, and the moſt part leaped ouer-boord.</p>
               <p>This victorious ſucceſſe of the Proteſtants in
<hi>Poictou</hi> and <hi>Xaintongne,</hi> were the occaſion that to preuent any greater conqueſts, the Prince <hi>d'Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> was appoynted to come down into <hi>Poictou,</hi> there to reaſſemble <hi>Puigail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lards</hi> forces, which now hopped but vpon one legge,<note place="margin">Succourd de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for Puigaillard.</note> and thoſe of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Lude,</hi> to the end to come to ſome new practiſe.</p>
               <p>The eleuenth of Auguſt after, the two great armies lying about the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of <hi>Loire,</hi> newes was brought vnto them of a peace agreed vpon between the king and the Princes, all precedent modifications and reſtrictions aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed: the ſecond Edict of peace confirmed and allowed,<note place="margin">The <hi>3.</hi> Edict of peace.</note> this peace was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of all men, with hope of revnion betweene the two parties, through all the Realme. The peace publiſhed in the Campes and Townes, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were diſcharged, aſſoone as they had conducted their ſtraungers into <hi>Lorraine,</hi> and the Princes accompanied with Countie
<hi>Lodowicke,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of October returned to <hi>Rochel:</hi> the king by the Edict granted foure Townes, <hi>Rochel, Montauban, Cognac,</hi> and <hi>la Charite,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Townes for aſſurance.</note> to bee kept in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces names, for the ſpace of two whole yeares: for aſſurance of this third E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of pacification, in the purſuite whereof,
<hi>Teligny,</hi> after ſonne in lawe to the Admiral, and <hi>Beauuais la Nocle</hi> imployed themſelues moſt faithfully, with great credite and reputation of all men.</p>
               <p>Touching the Admirall, if there were any Commaunder on both ſides that deſired peace, it was hee, as by letters dated the ſecond of March at <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal</hi> hard by <hi>Carcaſſonne,</hi> written to the king, the Queen, and the Duke of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> appeared. For being friend to militarie diſcipline (aboliſhed in thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ciuill warres) and enemie of vices, oftentimes beholding ſuch diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, hee ſaid: that if it pleaſed God to ſend peace in <hi>France,</hi> hee would deſire to die a thouſand deaths, rather then to fall againe into thoſe confuſions,<note place="margin">The Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall deſireth peace.</note> and once againe to ſee ſuch miſchiefes, leauing to all the reſt of the commanders the praiſe which they obtained, if in ciuil wars praiſe may be giuen, it may be ſaid, that the Admiral trauelled much both in bodie &amp; mind, hauing ſuſtained the heauieſt part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> affairs of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wars with much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancie, fidelitie, &amp; facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <pb n="242" facs="tcp:22081:122"/>and behauing himſelfe with as great reuerence towards the Princes his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, as modeſtie to his inferiors, he neuer ſpake of the king, the Queen, the Duke of <hi>Aniou,</hi> and thoſe whom hee knew to bee his capitall enemies, but with honour, without ſubtiltie or counterfeit ſpeeches, beeing the man among all thoſe of the religion, ſpecially among the Commaunders in the warre, who in a ſpeciall manner repoſed himſelfe vppon the prouidence of God.</p>
               <p>The priſoners that fell into his hands, were fauourably vſed by him, as courteous when hee had put vp his ſwoord, as fierce when he held it naked in hand. Pittie by him was alwaies had in ſingular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation: as alſo loue to iuſtice, wherein hee continued both priuate and publike, in time of peace and warre, vntill hee died: which made him both eſteemed and honored by thoſe whoſe part hee held. Hee ſought not ambitiouſly to haue commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements and honours, but ſhunning them, hee was conſtrained to accept them, by reaſon of his wiſedome &amp; good gouernment in mannaging armes: it might well be ſeene, that hee had as good knowledge therein, as any Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of his time, and alwaies expoſed himſelf couragiouſly in any dangers: wiſe in counſell, and valiant in fight: in aduerſities magnanimious, and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with wiſedome to auoydethem.</p>
               <p>And to conclude, hee was a man moſt woorthie and fitte to reſtore and re-eſtabliſh a feeble and corrupt eſtate: but it appeared in an vnfit time, and that which after happened vnto him, ſhe weth an exterior apparance, that vertue is but hardly aſſured heere on earth. Peace concluded and publiſhed, as it hath beene ſaid, the Admirall <hi>Teligny, la Noue,</hi> and diuers others, withdrew themſelues neare vnto the Princes in <hi>Rochel,</hi> there with more ſecuritie to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the aduancement and execution of the Edict.</p>
               <p>They put Garriſon for the Princes in the Townes of aſſurance, except in <hi>Rochell,</hi> which was maintained in her auncient priuiledges. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Maximilian</hi> the ſecond, not long after, married his eldeſt daughter to <hi>Phillip</hi> king of <hi>Spaine</hi> his brother in lawe: So that the vncle married the Neece.<note place="margin">The king married to Elizabeth of Auſtria.</note> 
                  <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his youngeſt daughter was after giuen in marriage to king <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, whom hee eſpouſed in the Towne of <hi>Mezieres,</hi> about the end of Nouember: and the foure and twentieth of December going to <hi>Parris,</hi> at <hi>Villiers coſte Rez,</hi> hee gaue audience to the Ambaſſadors of
<hi>Almaine,</hi> that deſired vnto he made an anſwere that contented them, wherewith they were honourably diſcharged. About the ſame time the Princes exhibited ſundrie complaints concerning the Edict, by the hands of
<hi>Briquemaut, Teligny, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uais, la Nocle,</hi> and <hi>Cauagnes. Teligny</hi> was the chiefe Agent, and ſeemed to bee highly in the kings fauour, to whom he propounded the complaints of the Proteſtants, wherevpon the king ſent forth ſundrie Commiſsioners throgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out al the Prouinces of his kindome, among other, the Marſhal <hi>de Coſſe,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with
<hi>Proutiere,</hi> Maiſter of Requeſts, who made a voyage to
<hi>Rochel,</hi> as well to conferre with the Queene and Admirall, concerning ſome conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent means to maintaine the realme in peace, as for other matters, that we will ſhortly ſpeake of.</p>
               <p>The firſt of Ianuary there beganne a conference betweene the Marſhall <hi>de Coſſe,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1571"/> and <hi>la Proutiere,</hi> with the Admirall, and other Deputies for the Queen
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:22081:122"/>of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and the Princes at
<hi>Rochel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proceeding with the Q. of Nauarre, the Princes, the Admiral, and thoſe of the religion, in the ſecond yeres of peace that the third edict of paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</note> touching the difficulties and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of diuers articles of the Edict. On both ſides complaints were made, touching the infraction thereof, with long replies, whereof enſued certaine reſolutions, that were to bee ſent vnto the king. I his aſſembly ſerued for a couerture, to a parley of a marriage betweene <hi>Henry de Bourbon</hi> Prince of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,</hi> and Ladie <hi>Margaret</hi> ſiſter to the king: as alſo to a conference with the Admirall touching the warre, which the king ſaid hee would beginne againſt the king of <hi>Spaine</hi> in the lowe Countries. And all this propounded and deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to drawe the Queene of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> the Princes, and the Admirall, to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> with all their principall ſeruants: and there to giue them that entertainment which after fell out. In March the Romiſh Catholicques at <hi>Roane,</hi> murthered diuers proteſtants as they returned from a Sermon, and beate others ſhrewdly, meaning to haue proceeded further, had not Marſhal <hi>Montmorencie,</hi> whom the king ſent, made the more haſte to ſuppreſſe the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the ſeditious, who after many purſuites hanged vp three or foure: the reſt eſcaped, albeit 400. were guiltie of innocent blood. Sixe weekes before, the proteſtants had been moſt cruelly murthered at <hi>Aurange</hi> by their enemies, whom <hi>Berchon</hi> (ſoone after made Gouernour by Countie <hi>Lodowic,</hi> found means to intrap and puniſh accordingly.) Not long after, by the kings conſent, thoſe of the religion were taxed to paye the 5. part of their reuenue, towards the payment of the Rutters, which produced much diſcontentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. About the ſame time the king and the Queene made their enterie vpon ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall daies into the capitall towne of the Realme with great pompe. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants alſo held a Sinode nationall at
<hi>Rochel,</hi> wherein they confirmed the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the confeſsion of their faith, and diſcipline of their Churches, in the preſence of the Queene of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> the Princes, and many other of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall among them. The king hauing made his entrie the eleuenth of March (the Queene beeing crowned the 25. of the ſame moneth at Saint <hi>Deunis,</hi> and the
29. receiued with great magnificence into <hi>Parris</hi>) hee went to ſit in his place of iuſtice in the Parliament, where hee made a long Oration to his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Court, for the obſeruation of his Edicts: In witneſſe whereof, in the moneth enſuing, the people of <hi>Parris</hi> beganne to mutine againſt thoſe of the religion, ſacked certaine houſes, and began to proceed further, prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by their Preachers, becauſe of a certaine Croſſe placed in S. <hi>Dennis</hi> ſtreet, (in a place where in times paſt ſtood the houſe of <hi>Phillip de Gaſtines,</hi> raſed to the ground, becauſe that certaine ſermons and the Lords Supper had beene made and celebrated therein, <hi>Gastines</hi> for that cauſe hauing been executed to death, during the troubles) that had beene carried into S.
<hi>Innocents</hi> Church-yeard. This mutinie appeaſed, the king that ſhewed great fauor to <hi>Teligny</hi> &amp; his companions, ſent them to the Q. of <hi>Nauarre</hi> &amp; the Princes in <hi>Rochel,</hi> to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them that all his deſire was to maintaine the peace, &amp; that for his owne part, he bare them great affection, procuring that the Q. his mother, &amp; the Duke of <hi>Aniou</hi> his brother, ſhould from day to day leaue off their rigors.</p>
               <p>And at their departure gaue them diuers preſents, giuing them likewiſe to vnderſtand, that his minde was to proceede with war againſt the Spaniard in the low Countries, and to marrie his ſiſter to the Prince of <hi>Nauarre. Biron</hi> was ſent after to certifie the like, and men began to ſpeake of that marriage in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ſorts, their opinions being diuided, ſome eſteeming it to bee a ſnare to intrap thoſe of the religion, others deeming the contrarie.</p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:22081:123"/>
               <p>The king cauſed certaine conſultations to be made in
<hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe of the alliance between both the parties. Pope
<hi>Pius</hi> the fiſt ſeemed to bee much troubled about the ſame, for that effect ſending Cardinal <hi>Salutati</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> who (hauing had certaine conference by word of mouth with the king) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſatiſfied.</p>
               <p>The effect of that the king ſaid vnto him, was, that the king would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſhewe himſelfe to deſerue the name of the eldeſt ſonne of the Romiſh Church, and that all his intents tended to no other end, but only to the ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, honour, and aduancement of the Catholicque religion, whereof the Pope ſhould receiue great teſtimonies before long time ſhould paſſe. But notwithſtanding that diuers maruelled much at this ſuddaine alteration of the king, the Queene of <hi>Nauarre</hi> much ſought vnto by diuers great perſons of both partes, went to the king, followed by the Countie <hi>Lodowicke,</hi> &amp; great numbers of Nobilitie. The king and the Queene his mother were at <hi>Blois,</hi> where they receiued and welcommed her with great ioy and good counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and after many diſputations touching diuers particular poynts, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the cerimonies, the agreement vpon the marriage of her ſonne with the kings ſiſter was concluded, and the place of the eſpouſals aſsigned at <hi>Parris.</hi> Not long after the Prince her ſon, accompanied with fiue hundreth Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men came to <hi>Blois,</hi> where the marriage of <hi>Nenry de Bourbon</hi> Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> with the yongeſt daughter of the houſe of <hi>Neuers</hi> was agreed vpon.

That at the Admirals returne to Court, the king ſhewed himſelf ſo warie, as his moſt inward friends did wonder at it, for thereby hee had brought the Admirall out of all ſuſpect, ſo that now the matter that the Cardinal wiſt of, might the better be put in execution. That there was much ſpeech of warre againſt the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> whereto the king ſeemed to incline, the rather thereby to ſtay the Admirall: that ſuch pollicies were to be practiſed, vntill they might find opportunitie to put in execution the ſecret counſell.

               <p>Wherevppon hee beſought his Maiſter, notwihſtanding whatſoeuer packets hee might receiue, to aſſure himſelfe that the king would neuer vary from the reſolution. That the Queene-mother and the Duke of

And although the Admirall had the copies heereof ſent him, hee made no great account thereof, no more then of other aduertiſements, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly giuen him both before and after.

Others of a more ſtirring ſpirit (after the manner of Frenchmen, who doo performe much in proſperitie, and neuer feare any aduerſitie vntil it commeth) would needes bee buſie about diſcipline, but they were ſoone put to ſilence.

               <p>The Princes truſting to an aſſured peace, three moneths before the time, reſtored the townes of aſſurance, wherein the king placed his Garriſons, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfying the Princes with letters, which hee had ſent to all his Courts <pb n="247" facs="tcp:22081:124"/>of Parliaments, wherein he declared his great good liking of the good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Princes, in that they did him ſo much honour, as faithfully to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye vppon his Edict, which he wiſhed to bee inuiolably obſerued.

The Marſhall of <hi>Montmorency</hi> was ſent into England to practiſe a league, who returned ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then hee was looked for: but toward the marriage gat him home to his owne houſe, and might hee haue beene beloued, the affaires had beene o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe mannaged then they were.</p>

               <p>In the beginning of May, the king deſired the Queene of

Where ſhee arriued the fifteenth day of the ſame moonth: and the fourth of Iune fell ſicke of a feuer, proceeding as ſome ſayde from her lights, where of long time certaine impoſtumes had bredde, which beeing mooued and ſtirred by great heates, and by an extraordinarie trauell, which ſhee alwaies tooke while ſhee was in health, inflamed and bredde that feuer:<note place="margin">Death of the Queene of Nauarre.</note> whereof ſhe died within fiue daies after, to the great ſorrow and extreame griefe of all her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. Three daies after ſhe fell ſicke, beeing in perfect memorie, ſhee made a moſt chriſtian teſtament and laſt will, dying with the witneſſe and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of ſingular pietie and ioy in God.</p>
               <p>She was a Princeſſe of great experience, both by many aduerſities, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe ſhewed an inuincible conſtancie, and heroicall greatneſſe of courage: moſt affectionate to her religion, very careful of the bringing vp of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the feare of God, charitable towards them whom ſhee often aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed of their duties: in words moſt graue, and full of motherly affection: ſhe had a readie wit and well aduiſed, but indowed with great zeale and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, pittifull and eaſie to bee perſwaded: no offender could auoyde her cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: ſhee oppoſed her ſelfe againſt vices, and liberally maintained that which ſhee iudged to bee good, and conformable to the will and pleaſure of God. Proſperitie hindered her, her mind much giuen to pleaſant conceits, being of a leane complexion, and very agreeable with her ingenioſitie, hauing great viuacite to comprehend all things, and grace liuely to repreſent them by writing or word of mouth: with a ieſture of all the bodie, and a countenance well liked of all men: ſhee died in the foure and fortieth yeare of her age, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ninth of Iune.</p>

They were not commaunded to open her braine, where the miſchiefe lay, by which means they could not giue aduiſe, but vppon the outward apparance.</p>
               <p>Certaine daies after, the king deſired his brother in law the king of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,</hi> to go to <hi>Parris,</hi> there to ſolemnize his marriage, as it had beene agreed betweene them. While that at <hi>Blandie</hi> in <hi>Brie</hi> preparation was made for the marriage of the Prince of
<hi>Conde,</hi> that married his wife in the beginning of the moneth of Auguſt.</p>
               <p>The Admirall at that time lay in his houſe of <hi>Chaſtillon ſur Loing,</hi> where hee receiued many letters and meſſages from the king,<note place="margin">The Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall commeth to Parris.</note> and becauſe he ſtirred not, the king ſent <hi>Cauagnes</hi> and <hi>Briquemaud</hi> to fetch him, to determine vppon the wars of <hi>Flaunders:</hi> and ſpecial commandement was giuen to the Prouoſt of Merchants in <hi>Parris,</hi> &amp; other the chief me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to take order that not any noiſe nor rumor ſhould be vſed or raiſed at the Admirals ariuall in the town, who beeing prouoked by ſo many men, and deſirous to banniſh warres out of <hi>France,</hi> meaſuring the kings thoughts by his owne, reſolued to ride to
<hi>Parris</hi> without ſtaying, at the many and diuers aduertiſments of his ſeruants, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honourable perſons moſt affected to his preſeruation, that both within and without the Realme deſired him, that ſeeing he could not conceiue any ſiniſter opinion of the king,<note place="margin">Confidence of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</note> his mother, and the reſt, that at the leaſt he would conſider into what place he went about to thruſt himſelfe, and among ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enemies, but hee reſting vppon the teſtimonie of a good conſcience, and the prouidence of God, remitting thoſe aduiſes, as if they proceeded from men couetous and deſirous of new troubles, which hee abhorred woorſe then death, went with a ſmall company, and beeing in
<hi>Parris,</hi> to the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhing of all the towne, was honourably receiued by the king, his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren, the Queene-mother and others.</p>
               <p>A little before, <hi>la Noue, Saucourt,</hi> and
<hi>Ienlis,</hi> accompanying Countie <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowic</hi> into
<hi>Flaunders,</hi> had from the king receiued commiſsion, to finde means to ſurpriſe ſome frontier towne: on the other ſide, the Duke of
<hi>Alue</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of euery ſteppe that Countie <hi>Lodowic</hi> ſet, which notwithſtanding ſuch was his diligence, that hee ſeized vpon

               <p>The ſeuenth of Iuly, the King publiſhed a proclamation, tending to the impeachment of all quarrels, as well in <hi>Parris</hi> as in his Court, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all ſtraungers and men that had nothing to do within the Towne,<note place="margin">The Princes come to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</note> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from thence. After the arriuall of the Admirall at <hi>Parris,</hi> ſo many letters and meſſengers were ſent vnto the Princes, that in fine, they came thither al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at the ſame time that the king arriued, who had before lingered therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.</p>
               <p>Many Lords and Gentlemen of the religion, accompanied the king of <pb n="249" facs="tcp:22081:125"/>
                  <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> whom in manner all the Court went to meete.</p>
               <p>Further, vnder pretence of the warres in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> the king at the ſame time ſent for other Lords and Gentlemen of the religion, who otherwiſe would haue ſtayed in their houſes. <hi>Ienlis</hi> marched not into <hi>Flaunders,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding hee were ſolicited thereto: beſides the ſolemnization of this marriage royall, was for a time deferred, by reaſon of the ſcruples &amp; doubts made by the Cardinall of
<hi>Bourbon</hi> to celebrate the ſame, without a diſpence from the Hope, that would bee prayed and intreated therevnto, and in the end graunt a diſpence: but becauſe it was not ample ynough to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalles minde, counſelled by men ſubtiller then himſelfe, they were forced to ſend to
<hi>Rome</hi> againe.</p>
               <p>Great was the expectation of <hi>Ienlis</hi> aduentures, who had gathered foure thouſand footemen, and fiue hundreth horſe,<note place="margin">Ienlis and his troupes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated.</note> for the ſuccor of Countie <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowicke</hi> and <hi>la Noue,</hi> whom the Duke of
<hi>Alue</hi> had beſieged in <hi>Monts.</hi> In the meane time commeth the new diſpenſation toward the ende of Iuly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Cardinal ſeemeth ſatiſfied: and the eighteenth day of Auguſt is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated for the marriage. In the meane time commeth the news of <hi>Ienlis</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and aduenture, whereat the king ſeemeth to bee much agreeued, who writeth to his Ambaſſadour in the lowe Countries, to procure by all poſsible meanes the deliuerie of the priſoners taken in that ſurpriſe: as alſo he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Admirall to ſend all the ſuccour hee may, to ioyne with the Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whom the Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> had buried at the ſame time, cauſing him to haue mony deliuered for the footemens paye, who were thought to amount to foure Regiments, beſides ſome thirtie companies of men at armes.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spaine</hi> ſeemed to be malecontent, becauſe the king went about to make war in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> and for the ſame cauſe withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe out of <hi>France:</hi> the Queene-mother alſo played many parts in this trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, faining not to haue knowne the kings proceedings, and knowing them, made as though ſhe would haue left the Court: in ſuch manner, that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, <hi>Teligny</hi> his ſonne in law, and other Lords, confirmed themſelues more and more, that the kings actions were correſpondant to the Admirals aduice: which was to make warre in the king of <hi>Spaines</hi> countries that had kindled it, and pretended to make warre in <hi>France,</hi> thereby in time to ceaſe vppon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Rochel inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for it ſelfe.</note>The laſt of Iuly, the Rochelers wrote vnto the Admirall, that the armie at ſea approached neare them, and that it ſpoyled the plaine Countri-men, comming euery day from <hi>Xantongue</hi> and <hi>Gaſcon,</hi> vſing terrible threatnings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their towne, openly ſpeaking of the ſpoyle thereof, ſending to aske his counſell therein, ſpecially touching the receiuing of eight hundreth men for Garriſon, which they ſought to put into the Towne. Hee made them an honourable aunſwere, dated the ſeuenth of Auguſt, aſſuring them of the care hee had ouer them: and added, that hee ſawe the king ſo well diſpoſed to the entertainment of peace, that all men had cauſe to commend him. The Rochelers notwithſtanding neglected not to looke vnto themſelues, and to fortifie their Towne.</p>
               <p>In other Townes their ranne diuers mutterings, and many were the threats of the Romiſh Catholicques againſt the Proteſtants, which daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <pb n="250" facs="tcp:22081:126"/>ſome of them. Others relied vppon the Admiralles preſence in the Court, and truſted to his anſwere: deliuered as well by word of mouth, as by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, vnto thoſe that asked his aduice vppon all accurrences, whoſe ſpeeches were in effect as followeth.</p>
               <p>That as concerning the Guiſians, whom they ſo vrged, the King had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken order by ſetting them at vnitie, and cauſing both parties to ſwear friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: that the marriage of the Ladie <hi>Margaret,</hi> whom the King gaue (ſaith hee) not to the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> onely, but as it were to the whole Church of the Proteſtants, to ioyne with them in an indiſſoluble vnion, was the type of their peace and ſafetie.</p>
               <p>Heerevpon hee often beſought ſuch as ſent him any packets, gaue him any aduice of the hatred of the King, the Queene-mother, the Duke of
<hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or the houſe of <hi>Cuiſe,</hi> againſt either himſelfe or the Proteſtants, no more to trouble him with any the paſſed calamities, but rather to be content with their daily prayers to God, to whom they were to giue thankes, that hee had vouchſafed to bring all matters to ſo quiet an end. In brief, the Admiral, euer like himſelfe, ſtood faſt in all theſe motions: not that hee knew not of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of infinite his aduerſaries that inuironed him: neither that beeing at <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> hee laye in the very goulf and deepeſt pit of death: but becauſe through conſtancie and long continuance, he had framed himſelfe to rely vpon Gods prouidence: as alſo for the hauing ſecretly layed open vnto the King the very ſprings of the ciuill warres in <hi>France,</hi> and moſt liuely painted foorth the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes of his ſecret enemies and treacherous ſeruants, that aymed at the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie (ſince it hath manifeſtly appeared) hee ſuppoſed that he had left him in a faire path to preuent them.</p>
               <p>For ſure it is, that the King, albeit as then but yong, had a very good wit, and could reaſonable wel perceiue the courſe of his affaires: ſo that had not ſuch bloodie and furious Councelles preuented and croſſed his capacitie, <hi>France</hi> had not incurred thoſe calamities, that ſince haue almoſt ſubuerted the whole eſtate thereof. For in the end he found, albeit ouer-late for his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and crown, that they that termed themſelues his ſeruants, ment nothing leſſe: but were his moſt cruell enemies, and ſuch as had exiled and murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his beſt ſubiects, to the end afterward with more facilitie to ridde their hands of himſelfe, and ſo to ſeize vppon the Realme.</p>
               <p>There happened yet an other matter, (as the waies of God are maruellous and vncomprehenſible) that more and more ſtopped the eares of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,<note place="margin">Negotiation of Polonia.</note> not to way ſo many aduertiſements as daily were giuen him, to depart out of
<hi>Parris,</hi> &amp; to take with him out of <hi>Parris,</hi> ſuch Lords, Gentlemen, and Captaines, as the Queene-mother, the Duke of <hi>Anion,</hi> the Guiſians, and the Parriſians, moſt vehemently hated. For certaine weekes before, it had been determined in the Councell, to ſend Ambaſſadours into
<hi>Polonia,</hi> king <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> beeing dead, to deſire the Eſtates to chuſe for their king the Duke of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> whom the Admirall accounted an irreconcileable enemie to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</p>
               <p>The Admirall therefore perceiuing that the king was earneſt to further that matter of <hi>Polonia</hi> for his brother, that had great credite throughout the Realme of <hi>France,</hi> iudged that the king had a good inſight, and deſired to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all things to a ſure and firme peace, that the Duke of <hi>Anion</hi> confined <pb n="251" facs="tcp:22081:126"/>in
<hi>Poland,</hi> his adherents would be conſtrained to become milder: that the houſe of <hi>Guiſe</hi> deſtitute of ſuch a ſtaye, and doubting the king, that many times looked with a fierce countenance, would bee carefull not to bee too buſie: that in time and not long, the Queene-mother would bee conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to leaue the conductions of the affaires of the Realme vnto her ſonne, wherevnto hee beganne to frame himſelfe, and perceiuing that the King and the Queene appoynted <hi>Iohn de Monluc</hi> Biſhoppe of
<hi>Valence,</hi> a man of great iudgement, and one that had effected many ſerious enterpriſes, and at other times, had trauelled into
<hi>Polonia</hi> for the ſame purpoſe, which voyage hee beganne the ſeuenteenth of Auguſt, it put him in better hope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monluc</hi> to the contrarie perceiuing the tempeſt at hand, deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then to get him out of <hi>France,</hi> that hee might not bee a witneſſe nor forced Councellour to the miſchiefes which hee perceiued readie to fall vppon thoſe of the religion. A little before, hee had wiſhed the Countie of <hi>Rochefoucaut</hi> &amp; other Lords, neuer to meddle in this imaginarie flemiſh war, but rather with ſpeed to return to their houſes: telling them, that they had no great cauſe to relie too much vpon the faire ſhewes of the Court, neither to ſoiourne long there, conſidering the enuie and mallice that moſt of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, and generally the whole cittie of <hi>Parris</hi> did beare them: but God would not ſuffer them as then to hearken to this good counſell. In the meane time, the Barron <hi>de la Garde</hi> poſting from <hi>Brouage</hi> to the Court,<note place="margin">The Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers ſtand vpon their guarde.</note> &amp; returning in great haft, wrote the 14. of Auguſt to the Rochelers, exhorting them to giue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite to the king, to his mother, and to the D. of of
<hi>Anion,</hi> &amp; not to miſtruſt the ſoldiers that lay round about: withal, promiſing them for his part al fauor, &amp; intreating them to intreat his men well that came to their Towne for their neceſſaries. Heerevpon they grew the more warie, and with like quoine and as good ſpeeches payd this ſpie, who writ himſelfe their moſt aſſured friend. The 17. of Auguſt, <hi>Henry</hi> king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and Ladie

               </p>
               <p>The king complained to them of the miſchiefe happened, ſwearing and promiſing to vſe and execute ſuch iuſtice vppon the offender, that the Admirall and his friends ſhould thinke themſelues ſatiſfied. In the meane time, he ſtayed them with promiſe ſhortly to take order therein: and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commaunded purſuite to bee made after the offendor: on the other ſide, willing the Prouoſt of Merchants in

<hi>Chally</hi> went to the Duke of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> chamber, where no man ſought for him.</p>
               <p>Two houres after noone, the king went to viſite the Admirall, to whom in preſence of the Queene-mother, the Admirall made a long declaration, <pb n="253" facs="tcp:22081:127"/>wherein hee forgot not to maintaine his fidilitie to the ſeruice of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of <hi>France,</hi> &amp; of others miſeries of the ſame, by reaſon the peace could not bee well obſerued, ſpecially touching thoſe of the religion, whereof he ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified ſome particularities, deſiring the K. to do iuſtice vpon the offendors: to haue regard vnto his faith and promiſe, and to the quietneſſe of the realm. The king made aunſwere, that he accounted him an honeſt man, a good Frenchman, and one that loued the increaſe of the Crowne: that he eſteemed of him as of a moſt diſcreet &amp; excellent Captain, and that vpon that opinion he had ſo farre entered into his former reſolutions, that his whole deſire was to haue his Edicts of peace fully executed, and yet deſired the maintenance thereof: and to that end ſundrie commiſsioners did paſſe through al the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces of the Realme, as the Queene his mother could well witneſſe. And ſhee affirming it, ſaying: that the Admirall himſelfe knew it full well. It is true, Madame (quoth hee) Commiſsioners were ſent, among the which, there were ſome that had condemned mee to be hanged, and promiſed fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiethouſand crownes to him that would bring you my head. The king pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſend others, with more oaths &amp; ſwearings, that hee would doo iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice vpon thoſe that hurt the Admirall. Many other ſpeeches hee vſed to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Admirall, who in the end forgot not to put the king in minde to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſuch aduertiſements as hee had many times giuen him, concerning the miſcheeuous practiſes of ſome againſt his eſtate and Crowne, withall, exhorting him to thinke vppon himſelfe, ſo farre foorth as he loued his own life.</p>
               <p>Soone after that, the king departed from him, <hi>Iohn de Ferriers,</hi> Vidame <hi>de Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres</hi> entered into the chamber, that beganne to comfort him, and in an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly not long after holden in a chamber of the ſame lodging, hee ſhewed the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> with others the chiefeſt Lords of the religion there aſſembled, that their ſureſt way was, preſently to depart out of <hi>Parris,</hi> and to make their account, that that blow was the beginning of the tragedie, which would ſoone after bee performed, but the aduice to ſtaye and truſt to the kings promiſe, was determined vppon, and the other reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

And whileſt the Secretaries were thus occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, the Dukes of <hi>Aniou</hi> and

               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:22081:128"/>
               <p>The King ſeemed to ſhewe an angrie countenance, and with ſharpe words ſaid vnto them, that they might go whither they would, and that hee would fetch them well ynough, if hee found them culpable of the iniurie offered vnto the Admirall. They departing from the kings preſence, well accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, about noone mounted on horſebacke, but not to go out of

Not long after, thoſe of the religion beganne to diſcouer, that ſome bloodie counſels were intended againſt the Admiral &amp; his friends. For firſt the king cauſed a gard of 50. harquebuſiers to be ſet at the Admirals gate, vnder the charge of
<hi>Coſſeins,</hi> diſlodged all the Romiſh Catholique Gentlemen out of that ſtreet: which done, he commaunded the Admiralles familiar friends to lodge in that quarter, that they might be neare about him: cauſed great ſtore of armes to be brought into the <hi>Louure,</hi> and about euening all the people in the towne beganne to be in armes. The Councell aſſembled for the laſt time in the Admirals lodging: Vidame <hi>de Chartres</hi> held his firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and ſought very earneſtly, that they ſhould preſently aſſay to beare the Admirall out of <hi>Parris,</hi> and that his familiars and friends ſhould preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge: hee ſhewed ſufficient reaſon for the ſame, which notwithſtanding were not followed they ſtood to the firſt, which importeth to craue iuſtice at the king hand, vppon whoſe promiſe they were to relie. Vidames <hi>de Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres</hi> counſel was moſt aſſured, but (in mans iudgement) as then impoſsible to be effected. And yet after that, men durſt report and that openly, that at that Councell where the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and diuers great Lords were aſſembled, they had determined to kill the King, the Queene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, and all the principall of the Court: a ſlaunder as falſe as falſehood it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>About euening, certaine Proteſtant Gentlement offered themſelues the ſame night to watch with the Admirall: which
<hi>Teligny</hi> his ſon in law would not ſuffér them to do, ſaying it was vnneceſſary, and ſo diſmiſſed them with very good words for their good will, ſo that there ſtayed no more with the Admirall, but <hi>Cornaton</hi> (from whoſe mouth I gathered the greateſt part of this diſcourſe) <hi>La-bonne, Yolet, Marlin</hi> a Miniſter of Gods word,
<hi>Ambroiſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> a Surgean, and certaine of his men. In the Court there were fiue Switzers of the king of <hi>Nauarres</hi> guard. Night being come, the D. of <hi>Guiſes</hi> Lieftena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in this action, which at this preſent is to be declared vnto the Duke of <hi>Aniou,</hi> ſent for all the Captaines of the Switzers,<note place="margin">Deſcription of the maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre of the Admirall.</note> and companies of ſtrangers ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into the Towne, ſhewing him his commiſsions to kill the Admiral &amp; all his partakers: exhorting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be couragious in ſhedding of blood and ſpoyle: and appoynted their troupes to be placed where he thought meete. About midnight an other aſſembly was made in the Towne-houſe, where the Prouoſt of Merchants, the Sheriffes, &amp; Captaines of euery quarter, were aduertiſed in like ſort, that throghout the realme the like ſhuld be done to all thoſe of the religion: &amp; that the watch-word of the general maſſacre ſhould be the bell of the Pallace, which ſhould be rung at the breake of day, and the badge of the executioners, ſhould be a white handkerchef tied vppon their ſleeues, &amp; a white croſſe in their hats. If the great perſonages were mooued, the meaner ſort were no leſſe readie to exececute that cruel commandement, <pb n="255" facs="tcp:22081:128"/>preſently watches were ſet in euery ſtreet, the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> beeing come to the

The noyſe of armour and running vp and downe with ſo many torches, ſoone after midnight, made diuers of thoſe of the religion that were lodged neare the Admirall, to come out of their lodgings into the ſtreets, to aske the firſt of their acquaintance what that extraordinary noyſe and arming ment at ſuch an vndue houre, but beeing anſwered with doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſpeeches, they went forward towards the <hi>Louure,</hi> where firſt they were quarrelled withall, and ſet vppon by the guard.

The Admirall beganne to ſay: It is long ſince I diſpoſed my ſelfe to die: ſaue you your ſelues if it bee poſsible, for you cannot ſaue my life: I commit my ſoule into the hands and mercie of God. Preſently al of them, except his Interpreter for the Almaine tongue, got vp into the top of the houſe, and hauing found a window to iſſue out vppon the roofe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the gutters, beganne to ſaue themſelues, but moſt of them were ſlaine in the next houſe: <hi>Cornaton, Merlin,</hi> and one or two more eſcaped, and were miraculouſly preſerued. There ſtood foure Switzers vpon the ſtaires, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one being ſlaine, the reſt fled as well as they might. The Admirals cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber opened, ſeuen or eight men all armed, and with their targets entered into it, and one named <hi>Beſmes</hi> ſeruant to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> with a naked ſwoord in hand went to the Admirall, offering him the poynt, wherewith he began to ſay: Young man, thou oughteſt to reſpect my age and infirmitie, yet ſhalt thou not ſhorten my life: with that <hi>Beſmes</hi> thruſt him into the bodie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling the blowe vpon his head, euery one of the reſt gaue him a blow, in ſuch ſort, that he fel vpon the ground, and ſo lay gaſping. The Duke of

               <p>They perceiuing that the maſſacre of <hi>Parris</hi> would not quench the fire, but rather kindle it more, becauſe thoſe of the religion might aſſemble and vnite themſelues togither, (as it happeneth in ſuch miſerable chances) giue them new worke: theſe Councellours made two meſſengers, the one from the ſame Sunday, to the Gouernours and ſeditious Catholicques of Towns, <pb n="258" facs="tcp:22081:130"/>wherein were diuers of the religion, with expreſſe commaundement to maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre them. The other meſſage contained certaine letters to the Gouernours of <hi>Prouence,</hi> by the which hee charged thoſe of <hi>Guiſe</hi> with the murther com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vppon the perſon of the Admirall, becauſe of their particular quarrell, and of the ſedition happened in <hi>Parris,</hi> ceaſed the ſame day it began, (as thoſe letters of the foure and twentieth of Auguſt ſpecified) by the authoritie and vigilancie of the King, whoſe meaning and commaundement was, that his Edict of pacification ſhould be holden as much as euer it was,<note place="margin">Strange de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes to roote out thoſe of the religion, and to couer the action of the maſſacre.</note> through all his Realme. Wherevnto he added theſe words. And becauſe it is greatly to bee feared, that ſuch execution (which by other letters was publiſhed to bee made vpon a very ſmall number) ſhould cauſe my ſubiects to riſe one againſt the other, and that great maſſacres ſhould bee committed within the townes of my Realme, which would bee great griefe vnto me: I pray you to publiſh and make it knowne in all the places of your Gouernment, that euery man ſhould liue in peace, without raiſing armes, nor offending each other vpon paine of death: cauſing our edict of pacification to be carefully obſerued and kept, and to puniſh the contradictors, and ouerrunne thoſe that would ſeem to riſe and bee diſobedient to our will: you ſhall preſently aſſemble all the forces you can make, as well of friends as of your ordinarie companies, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſing the Captaines of the Townes and Caſtles of your gouernment, to looke well to the ſafetie and preſeruation of the ſaid places, that no fault may bee eſcaped, aduertiſing mee aſſoone as poſsible you may, what order you haue taken therein, and how all things paſſe within your gouernment.</p>

The Queene-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther likewiſe wrote her letters to the Gouernours and Ambaſſadours in like ſubſtance as the king.</p>
               <p>It was agreed betweene the King, the Queen-mother, his brother,

               </p>
               <p>Vppon this counſell the King had in his Sunday letters, layd the whole rage vppon the Guiſians, who conſidering more deeply the inormitie of the act, wherein they had not ſpared an infinite number of learned men, hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable olde age, honeſt Ladies, chaſte matrones, women with childe, young ſchollers, virgins, ſucking babes, but moſt cruelly cut their throates: percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that ſo they ſhould bring vpon themſelues &amp; their poſteritie, the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of all men indued with any ſparke of vertue, or that had any regard of humane ſocietie: and conſequently, make themſelues the marke for euery man to ayme at, as the ſole authors thereof, and men guiltie of the moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked action that could bee deuiſed: refuſed to forſake <hi>Parris.</hi> But contrariwiſe, inſiſted and moſt earneſtly laboured, that the king ſhould aduow all that had beene done.</p>
               <p>This did they and their Councell ſo cunningly mannage, beſides that <pb n="259" facs="tcp:22081:130"/>they were very ſtrong and greatly in the peoples fauour, who had been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> in this execution, that the king with the aduice of his Councell, ſoone after writ other letters to his Ambaſſadours, Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of Prouin ces and chiefe Townes of <hi>France:</hi> wherein hee gaue them to vnderſtand, that whatſoeuer had fallen out at <hi>Parris,</hi> was nothing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning religion, but was done onely to preuent the execution of a curſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie, practiſed by the Admirall and his confederates againſt him, his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and bretheren: and therefore commaunded that his Edict of pacificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould bee moſt firmly obſerued: But if it ſhould fall out that any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenors, incenſed with the newes of <hi>Parris,</hi> ſhould gather in armes in any place whatſoeuer, hee commaunded his ſaid Gouernours to aſsiſt the ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and diſpearſing of them.</p>
               <p>Alſo to the end the ſtudious of nouelties ſhould not commit any ſiniſter practiſe, his meaning was to haue the gates of all his Towns wel &amp; diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept, referring thereſt of his minde to the credite of the bearers.

               <p>There was a long Commentarie made and added to the ſame declaration, by one <hi>Gui de Fuur,</hi> Lord of <hi>Pibrac:</hi> as it was auouched before that of religion, who durſt affirme that witneſſes had been examined before the kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,<note place="margin">Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries vpon this matter.</note> that affirmed a conſpiracie made by the Admirall, not naming who, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet ſpecifying any circumſtance of apparance of trueth, for the which cauſe, certaine ſharpe aunſweres were made therevnto, wherein all the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uillations of the ſaid Commentarie, were amply and particularly reſuted.</p>

That the declaration did neither ſpecifie the time, place, adherents, nor meanes of this coniuration. Before the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall was hurt, as he receiued all fauour of the king, ſo he held and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him for one of his moſt faithfull ſeruants, whereof the Admirall made proofes with all ſinceritie.

Beſides this, after he was wounded, the Phiſitians and Surgeans had inioyned him ſilence, and all the Councels holden in his chamber, tended reſolutely to expect iuſtice to be done vppon thoſe that had hurt him, as the King and the Queen-mother had ſworne and promiſed. The King of
<hi>Nauarre</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> were alwaies at thoſe Councels, and to conſpire againſt the King, was as much as if they had ſoght to ſtab the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, &amp; to ſtain their houſe with the moſt deteſtable ignomie that could bee deuiſed.

Could the Admiral hope for a Prince more fauourable then hee, or that could better reuenge the outrage that had been done vnto him?</p>

<hi>Parris,</hi> without expecting the iuſtice that he had promiſed to execute vpon the wonder of the Admirall, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired againſt his Maieſtie, his mother, his bretheren, the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and other the Lords and Princes about them, and againſt the eſtate: yea, that ſome of the chiefeſt and adherents to the conſpiracie, acknowledging their fault, had confeſſed it.</p>

<hi>Parris,</hi> wiſhing his friends and familiars to follow after: as hourely diſcouering many things that put him in more doubt. Hee was in manner the onely man that was of that opinion: for the reſt, they ſtood vppon it, that ſo they ſhould doo the king wrong, in that they ſhould call into queſtion his faith and ſincere meaning: that it might ſuffice quietly and modeſtly to craue iuſtice at his hands: that the matter was yet freſh, and therefore it might bee feared, leaſt the king ſhould bee offended if they proceeded ſo hotly.

               <p>To returne to the Rochelers, that perſiſted in their determination. About the beginning of October, the enemie beganne by ſundrie means to cut off their victualles and prouiſion, vnder pretence of relieuing the Nauy that might depart farre ynough from them: but they ſoone blew vp that myne. Then was there an other aduiſe, which was this: Diuers Gentlemen and good ſouldiers were withdrawne thither for ſuccour, who purpoſed to ſet a large price vpon their skinnes to any that ſhould aſſayle them: and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers likewiſe were departed the Realme. Heervppon the king by his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters pattents of the eight of October, ſaith: that as a good houſholder he pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth his ſubiects that liue in penurie out of their own houſes: and ſo emoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his Gouernors of Prouinces throughout their iuriſdictions, by publike proclamation to call home ſuch as were abſent, whoſe goods hee decreeth to be confiſcate, in caſe they returne not within a certaine time limitted them. The ſame day the Barron <hi>de la Garde,</hi> intruding himſelf by letters to threaten the Rochelers, had his aunſwere: That they were the kings faithful ſeruants, though hee were none, who wrongfully moleſted them with his Gallies, and would not retire: That they prayed God to mollifie the Barrons heart, that hee might not trouble them, but ſet them at libertie: That they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to maintaine themſelues in their priuiledges: to keep their towne ſafe from like murther as were committed in other Towns, which they accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted innocent from the crime of rebellion, wherewith the Barron charged them.</p>
               <p>That ſo long as they heard and beheld ſuch and ſo horrible nouelties, and were by the Barron ſo boldly intreated as they had beene, they might and would, iuſtly poure foorth their complaints to God and the King. Whileſt <hi>Biron</hi> and others did thus, but in vaine, ſolicit the Rochelers, there was at <hi>Parris</hi> contriued an Edict of the tenth of October, in the name of the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> wherein he prohibited all publike exerciſe of any but the Romiſh religion throughout his countries.</p>

               <p>He going the next day to lye at <hi>Sigongnes,</hi> which was three leagues thence, certaine ſouldiers of the companie of Saint

This ſcandall troubled the Rochelers, who ended it thus. That

               <p>Many miſliked that <hi>Vigean</hi> a Gentleman of the religion, and a man of calling, ſhould take vpon him ſuch a commiſsion: but his reward cauſed him to bee afterward better aduiſed. Now the Rochelers beeing diuerſly aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, that ſhortly they ſhould ſee an armie before their walles: alſo that their Towne was the marke whereat their enemies aymed, gaue a new onſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Countrie of

Their Deputies ſet ſaile in the euening, the fiue and twentieth day of October. Thus was it open warre: for ſo many as were known to be Rochelers, were euery where taken priſoners and put to their ranſome: all veſſels ſayling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their hauen ſtayed: all marchandize found to belong to any Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, ſeized and confiſcate: to bee ſhort, all actions of hoſtilitie put in practiſe againſt them.</p>
               <p>Neither were the Sancerreans at that time much quieter: for

               <p>The ninth of Ianuarie there appeared ſome troupes of horſe, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſome foure hundreth Maiſters, and the next day fiue Enſignes of the old bands of the Regiment of <hi>Goas,</hi> with ſundrie other troupes gathered thereabout.</p>

There came alſo ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene Enſignes of Pioners, ſo as the whole armie amounted to ſome foure or fiue hundreth horſe, and ſome fiue thouſand foote, beſides the Pioners and Peſants.</p>
               <p>The Lord of <hi>Chaſtre</hi> Generall of the armie, ſent a drumme with letters to ſummon the beſiegers to yeelde vppon compoſition, which hee promiſed ſhould bee reaſonable. His drumme they ſtayed and made no other anſwere: which afterward prooued very preiudiciall vnto them, albeit in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they made many gallant and profitable ſallies. In the beginning of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruarie, the beſiegers erected a Fort within foure hundreth paces of the Towne towards <hi>Fontenay,</hi> and bringing their artillerie by boates vpon <hi>Loire,</hi> namely twelue cannons and foure coluerins, they made a bulwarke of earth vppon the highway to Saint

               <p>All this thunder hurt not any of the Inhabitants, but one maid, who was <pb n="272" facs="tcp:22081:137"/>ſlaine with the breath of a bullet, at one of the foure firſt ſhotte: ſo fierce was the ſtorme, that the ſtones of the towne-wall, the pauing ſtones, and ſhiuers of the timber of ſuch houſes as the cannon came vnto, flew whiſtling in the ayre, broke the ſtockes of the harguebuziers in their hands, and vppon the ſhoulders of the beſieged ſouldiers, rent and pierced their mandillians, hoſe and hattes, yet neuer touched their bodies. Namely, one bullet carried from a ſouldier, named <hi>Pauilloy,</hi> the creſt of his murrian, but otherwiſe hurt him not.</p>
               <p>An other cannon ſhot piercing cleane through the wal, came with ſuch violence, that lighting vppon a barne, it bare away a great quarter of ſtone, which fell vppon a woorthie mans backe named <hi>Petit Boys,</hi> yet hurt him not. An other ſhot lighting vppon the Courtin and Parapet of the Towne, caſt down aboue a Cart-load of ſtones &amp; brickbats, hard by the Miniſter of <hi>la Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,</hi> named <hi>Iohn de Lery,</hi> (from whom we haue the whole diſcourſe of this ſiege, whereat hee was from the beginning to the end) ſo as ſome flew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his legges with ſuch violence as any man may imagine, yet hit him not.

               <p>Now albeit the like batterie was ſtill continued ſo ſuriouſly againſt the wals, that were but weak before, wherin the beſiegers diſcharged aboue ſix thouſand cannon ſhot againſt the Town, yet of the beſieged there were not fiue and twentie ſlaine by that meanes.</p>
               <p>About the end of Februarie, the beſiegers laboured to ſurpriſe a rauelin, where they were fierſly repulſed, and loſt Captaine <hi>Diuory,</hi> with fiue and twentie ſouldiers of the olde bands that mere ſlaine in the place, beſides a number of wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded that they caried away.

The continuall raine and ſnow did wonderfully annoy both parties, eſpecially the beſiegers, to whom the beſieged with artificial fiers burned a wooden bridge couered with har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, wher vnder they vſed to come ſafe to the foot of rauelin without diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, and it was thought that they ſhould haue either ſtopped or myned that rauelin and therefore the beſieged did immediately dig Wels to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termyne that ſide.</p>
               <p>Alſo becauſe the beſiegers had immediately made a ſtronger bridge then the former: withal, that they hallowed the Rauelin, in the euening the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged cauſed Captaine <hi>Montauban</hi> to go foorth with fiftie ſhot, who brake through a Corps de guard, and ſlew thirteene or foureteene ſouldiers, and brought in two priſoners, who aſſured him that they myned vnder the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelin, and in an other place, wherevpon in the morning they began 7. wels in ſundrie partes of the Town ditches to blowe vp the ſaid mynes, as alſo they looked to other their fortifications according as neceſsitie commanded and appoynted.</p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:22081:137"/>
               <p>Three dayes after, towards nine of the clocke at night,<note place="margin">The firſt aſſault</note> comming vndeſired through their trenches, entered the ditch, not farre from the breach of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> which they found ſo welkept, that with the loſſe of ſundrie of their men ſlaine, and a number of wounded, they were forced to retire. During the whole conflict, which was both long and ſharpe, the beſieged continually ſung Pſalmes, wherevppon the beſiegers diſcharged ſome ſhot, from the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie that lay vpon the hill called the <hi>VVolphes</hi> elme, which ſel into the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier, euen vnder the feete of the beſieged ſouldiers, which was therewith ſhaken, yet had no farther hurt or harme.

               <p>Vppon the ſeuenteenth of March, there ſallied ſome fortie ſouldiers, who ſurpriſed a corps de guard, ſlew ſome eighteene or twentie ſouldiers, and brought in a priſoner, who aſſured the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that beſell the next day, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they ſhould bee beaten with ſixteene great peeces, which indeede made a great breach.</p>

<hi>VVolphes</hi> elme, and the <hi>Smithes Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy,</hi> battered and beaten downe all the towers and walles of the towne, and continued and made plaine the breach, which was aboue three hundreth paces wyde, their white Enſigne Colonel, followed by the reſt, ſhewed it ſelfe in order of battell, all their men comming vnder couert,<note place="margin">A generall aſſault in ſun drie places.</note> through their trenches euen to the edge of the Towne ditch, where they gaue the aſſault as followeth.</p>
               <p>

               <p>This firſt aſſault was famous, for the aſſaylants came in good order and verie reſolutely to the breach: wherevpon they cambered, &amp; ſeuen or eight of the beſt armed and couered came to handie blowes: namely, Captaine <hi>Ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Sarrieu</hi> his Enſigne, who carried his Enſigne &amp; brought it backe againe. After their repulſe, the Lord of <hi>Bonniuet,</hi> the Gentlemen of the countrie, and Captaine <hi>Cartier,</hi> gaue the ſecond charge, whereto they came with ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, that ſome of them twiſe entered the breach: among others, <hi>Fontain Carters</hi> Enſigne, one that was reuolted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the religion, who was there hurt, &amp; ſo returned lame &amp; halting. In this ſecond onſet, four Enſignes acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with four or fiue hundreth ſouldiers valiantly entered the ditch, but in liew of marching ſtraight to the breach, they ioyned cloſe with the corner of the wall, which they did ſtill beare with the ordinance, where they ſtayed with their Enſignes, and could not bee indammaged by the Townſmen, who were not able to ſtand vpon the wall that parted them, by reaſon of the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of cannon ſhot.</p>
               <p>Eaſily might they haue beene beaten away with muskets and hargue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buze-ſhot, out of ſome flanquers that yet remained toward the Gooſe-gate, <pb n="274" facs="tcp:22081:138"/>but at that time there was neither muskettier nor harguebuzier there about. Yet ſel there out one aduenture to the preſeruation of the beſieged, and that was this. As the cannoniers did without intermiſsion, continue the batterie from a place called the
<hi>Smithes Carroy,</hi> thinking to lay the wall flat, and ſo to diſcouer the patforme, wherevppon the beſieged did fight, they followed their purpoſe ſo obſtinatly, that with the diſchrarge of two or three vallies of cannons, they beate down ſo many ſtones vpon the foure Enſignes and their ſouldiers, that they were forced to retire: as alſo it fell out well with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, that the cannoniers in this batterie wanted powder: for had they bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten downe ſixe or ſeuen foote more of the wall, the platforme from whence the beſieged fought in flancke, and was their chiefe defence, had been layd open and made a bridge for the aſſailants, without let to haue entered the Towne: for this platforme beeing made on the ſuddaine, was not behinde cut off from the ſide of the Towne, and in other places they could not haue reſiſted.</p>
               <p>The ſixe Enſignes of <hi>Goas</hi> Regiment, aſſaulted the Rauelin of the olde gate, and <hi>Boudins</hi> platforme, ſupportee by the Lord of <hi>Montigny,</hi> Lieſtenant to the Countie of <hi>Brienne,</hi> and ſome other Gentlemen: there was <hi>Cabaſſoles,</hi> a Captaine of one of the companies of the olde bandes, a valiant man and greatly bewailed among the beſiegers.</p>
               <p>The new companies, except <hi>Teſſiers</hi> ſet vppon the great breach, and gaue the aſſault from the platforme of the olde gate, euen to the other ende of the breach toward Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> gate. Captaine <hi>Teſſier</hi> preſented the eſcalade to <hi>Caezars</hi> gate, which was at the other end of the Towne, that ſo the aſſault might bee generall, and the beſieged buſied in euerie corner. Of the Sancer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans, Captaine <hi>Flur,</hi> his Lieftenant <hi>Chaillou,</hi> and
<hi>Montauban,</hi> his Cornet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the breach of <hi>Londis,</hi> but before they could come to it, or ſet their ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in array, two of their men were carried away with a cannon ſhot. The reſt of the Captains, had euery man his quarter appoynted, where they all bare themſelues moſt valiantly: and the walles were euery where furniſhed, beſides a number left in the principall places, to ſerue for accurrences. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the aſſault, the fifteene hundreth labourours in the vines before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned with their ſlings, furniſhed with ſtones by the women and maides, wrought wonders, and wounded many of the enemies: Euen in the chiefed of the fight a woman caught hold of a ſouldiers pike, and ſtroue to wreſt it out of his fiſt.</p>
               <p>A young man of the Towne named <hi>Ialot,</hi> being in fight taken by a target-man, and ledde away, as hee deſcended into the ditch, called to his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions rather to ſhoote at him, then to ſuffer him to be carried away: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon one of them lying on his face, aymed ſo right, that hee killed the tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get-man, and then <hi>Ialot</hi> with his dagger ſlew an other that had hold on him, and ſo eſcaping returned through the breach to his fellowes. The defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants had no other fence but their ſmall ſhot, ſwoords, and ſlings: neither could they make vſe of their other Engines, in regard that this general aſſault was giuen ſooner then they expected, by reaſon of the batterie that had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued all the morning.</p>
               <p>The Sancerreans in this aſſault had ſeuenteene ſouldiers either ſlaine or wounded to death, beſide a wench that was carried away with a cannon <pb n="275" facs="tcp:22081:138"/>The aſſailants left in the ditch ſome threeſcore of the valianteſt: beſides ſome two hundreth that hauing their deadly woundes, died in their tents and lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, and as many more wounded, who albeit they did in time recouer, yet carried the markes to their graues.<note place="margin">The aſſaila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to famiſh the Towne.</note> Thence foorth the aſſaylants vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſtate of the Towne, reſolued to ſhut vp and ſtarue the Sancerreans, through the multitude of forts that they erected hard by their wals: which being made fenceable, notwithſtanding whatſoeuer the defendants skirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, they planted two coluerins in the greateſt, and ſo returned the reſt of their peeces to the towns where they tooke them, alwaies leauing ſufficient ſtrength round about to ſtop the beſieged from comming forth, or receiuing any reliefe out of the countrie. In the beginning of Aprill, one of the towne ſouldiers ſlipping downe the Towne-wall, came to the greater fort, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured them that the defendants began to famiſh. Within two daies after, the beſieged in a ſallie ſlewe ſome of their enemies, who the ſurer to girt in the Towne, erected fiue new ſmall forts, and nightly ſtood very carefully vpon their guard, ſo that the defendants perceiued that they ment to take them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the throats then by the fifts.

               <p>In the end they were conſtrained to eate Horſes, Cattes, Rattes, Moles, Mice, and dogges: hides of oxen, calues and ſheepes skinnes, parchment, horſehoues, hornes of lanterns, halters, and furnitures for horſes, girdles of leather, hearbs, and wilde rootes: and in the end of Iune, the third part of the beſieged eate no more bread, ſuch as could get linſeede and other ſeedes, which they neuer thought on, cauſed them to bee ground or beate them in morters, and made bread thereof, as alſo of all ſorts of hearbs mixed with a litle bran, if they could get it. They eat bread of ſtraw-meale, of powder of nutſhels, and of ſlate: ſuet, olde oyntment, and other olde greace, ſerued to make pottage, and to frie the excrements of horſes and of men, and the filth in the ſtreetes were not ſpared. And the twentieth of Iuly, a poore labourer and his wife were taken and executed, for eating the head, the entrailes, and the braines of their daughter of three yeares of age, that died by famine and miſerie: hauing dreſſed all the reſt of the bodie to eate it at other times: an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther olde woman lodged in their houſe, and that had eaten part of that coſtly banquet, died in priſon not long after her apprehenſion. There were that were found guiltie of other faults, but that which agrauated the latter fault, was, that the ſame day when they did the fact, they had bin comforted with certaine pottage made of hearbs and wine, which might well haue ſatisfied them in that time of neceſsitie. Such as went and were put foorth of the Towne to ſeeke reliefe, ſeeking to paſſe, were either ſlaine by the enemie, or conſtrained by blowes with ſtaues to turne backe againe. And ſtaying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, as not being able, or elſe wold not enter into the towne, they liued of the ſprigs of vines, blackberries in hedges, of red ſnailes, &amp; of hearbs. And moſt <pb n="276" facs="tcp:22081:139"/>of them died betweene the trenches and the ditches. Among other pittifull ſpectacles, the bodie of a laborour &amp; his wife, were found dead one hard by the other, among the vines, and two of their children weeping by them, the leſſer being but ſixe weekes olde, which a reuerent and charitable widow in the Towne tooke home to her houſe. If many died among the vines hard by the trenches and in the ditches, there died many more in the houſes and ſtreetes, where they fell downe in euerie place, and ſome daies they buried fiue and twentie or thirtie that died for hunger: almoſt all the young childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder the age of twelue yeares died: great pittie it was to heare the poore fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers &amp; mothers lament and mourne: the greateſt part of them neuertheleſſe ſtrengthening themſelues with the aſſurance of the grace of God, of the which I will recite two notable accidents. A young boy of the age of fiue yeares, hauing languiſhed certaine weekes, running along the ſtreets, in the end nature failing, fell down before his father and mother, who at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant perceiued the ſinues of their infant to ſhrinke in, as if they had been cut, and preſently the body died. An other young boy of tenne yeares of age, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the poynt of death, hearing and ſeeing his father and mother weeping and lamenting about him, whom hee felt vppon the armes and legges, that were as drie as wood, ſaid vnto them. Why do you weepe in this ſort to ſee me die for hunger? I aske you no breade mother, for I know you haue it not: but ſeeing it is the will of God, that I ſhould die in this ſort, I muſt take it thankfully. The holy man <hi>Lazarus</hi> had hee not hunger? haue I not red that in the Bible? and ſaying ſo hee yeelded his ſpirit vnto God. Vpon the thirtieth day of Iuly, the meanes that ſtayed the death of all this people, in the end of Iuly was certaine horſes of ſeruice reſerued for the extremitie, and ſix kine kept, to giue milke for certaine young children, which beaſtes were killed, and the fleſh ſold to comfort thoſe that liued, with a little corne, which ſome by ſtealth brought into the Towne, cut and gathered by night, wheres pound of corne was ſold for halfe a crowne, but this meanes continued not long by reaſon of the watch, which the enemie kept ſtraight. The warre kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led but eightie foure perſons within <hi>Sancerre,</hi> but famine killed both within and without the Town, aboue fiue hundreth, beſides thoſe that languiſhed: who hauing eſcaped, had much paine and labour to recouer themſelues. During theſe miſeries, diuers ſouldiers and fugitiues in <hi>Sancerre,</hi> got out by ſeuerall meanes, ſhunning the famine, deſiring rather to die by ſword: ſome of them being ſlaine, the reſt kept priſoners, and ſome executed. So all hope in mans iudgement failing to thoſe of <hi>Sancerre,</hi> the king hauing ſworne that hee would make them to deuour each other, the prouidence of the king of all kings holpe them by a ſtraunge meanes. Through the endeuours of the Biſhop of <hi>Valence,</hi>

                  <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Aniou</hi> brother to the king, and his Liefte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant generall in <hi>France,</hi> had been accepted for king of

So that in the end,<note place="margin">Compoſition with San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerre.</note> after certaine conferences meeting and iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying too &amp; fro, hoſtages beeing giuen on each ſide, it was agreed that they ſhould iſſue with their armes and goods, and ſuch as would ſtay, not to bee called in queſtion for any thing paſt: permitting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to diſpoſe of their goods as they thought good, with promiſe to preſerue the honour of women and maides: vppon condition, that the Inhabitants and other fugitiues, ſhould pay the ſumme of fortie thouſand frankes, to <hi>Monſieur de Chaſtre,</hi> who by that agreement entered vppon the laſt of Auguſt. The Miniſters, diuers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, Captaines, ſouldiers, and refuged perſons retired with paſports, with ſafe conduct, ſome to one place, ſome to an other. Not long after, <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerre</hi> was wholly vnwalled, ſome houſes throwne downe, the clocke, the belles, and other furnitures of the Towne taken away, the Bailiffe <hi>Ioan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi> maſſacred by night, within one hundreth paces of <hi>Monſieur de Chaſtres</hi> lodging. The twefth day of Septemb.
<hi>la Chastre</hi> being retired to <hi>Bourges,</hi> the Bailiffe of
<hi>Berry</hi> was left gouernor of that deſolate place: with two co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies of foote, and ſome other troupes, there were made diuers ſtraunge ſackings and pillages, in ſuch ſort, that it is wonder that
<hi>Sancerre</hi> ſhould ſtand vpright, and bee inhabited as at this day it is, and beſides the reſtoration of the walles, buildings, and repeopling, it hath the free exerciſe of the religion in this year 1595. when we finiſhed this collection or recueil. Now conſequently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our purpoſe, let vs conſider of the ſiege of <hi>Rochel,</hi> togither with the end thereof, in the yeare 1573. At the beginning,<note place="margin">A diſcourſe of the ſiege of Rochel, euen from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning vntill the peace graunted to the beſieged.</note> the Lord of <hi>Biron</hi> tried againe to finde ſome meanes of agreement, but could not compaſſe any: for the Rochelers could not perceiue anything but danger in all their negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as deeming their beſt ſafetie at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time to reſt in miſtruſt. In the mean time, it chanced that two ſoldiers verie forward to the field, not regarding that the Councell vpon good conſiderations, would not at all times ſuffer ſuch to go foorth as would, gat downe by a long lather into the ditch, in a place ſince that time very famous, and named the
<hi>Bastion</hi> of the Goſpell. Theſe hauing paſſed the Counterſcarp, found playynough, for one of them was ſlaine, the other eſcaped, but gaue ſo hotte an alarume at the gate, that they could not poſsibly retaine the ſouldiers or their Captaines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>La Noue</hi> vnderſtanding that many were in danger, did ſuddainly gather his forces both on foote and horeſbacke, and made haſte to the ſuccour: the skirmiſh begunne in ſundrie places, continued aboue fiue houres. Of the towne, three or foure were ſlaine, and twentie wounded: but of the campe, they loſt one hundreth, and fiftie wounded, beſides two Captaines carried priſoners into the town. Among others, to the skirmiſh came a certain yong Gentleman, Nephew to <hi>Puigaillard</hi> Gouernor of
<hi>Angiers,</hi> who with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blaſphemie, boaſted that he was one of the Ad. murtherers, &amp; ſhewing anaked curtelaſſe, which ſaid he, he broght fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo famous a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>flict, he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to make a butcherie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Rochelers fleſh: now being in place of triall, <pb n="278" facs="tcp:22081:140"/>his heart failing him, and ſeeking for his feete hee was taken priſoner. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon all the ſence of his tongue failing, hee could neuertheleſſe vſe any wit, but ſeeking to eſcape loſt his life: for finding ſome that could outrunne him, hee was ouertaken, ſlaine, and ſtripped, and ſo left naked in the fields, where in the night the dogges had torne his face: how be it in the morning at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie of the L. of <hi>Floyacs</hi> widow, a Gentlewoman well bent to the religion, his wretched carkaſſe was brought and buried in the Towne, which in his life time hee had ſo threatned. After this skirmiſh, <hi>Biron</hi> beganne to renue the negotiation committed to the Abbot of <hi>Gadaigne,</hi> who was deputed to bring the Rochelers to ſome compoſition: but it tooke no effect, becauſe that daily they detected ſome newe conſpiracie. And in deede at the ſame time, a Gentleman in <hi>Rochel</hi> reuealed to the Maior and chiefe of the Councell, ſuch intelligence as <hi>Biron</hi> and others had continued with him for the ſurprize of the towne.</p>
               <p>Hee wiſhed to allure into <hi>Rochel</hi> the ſtouteſt Captains of the campe, with ſome good number of ſouldiers, where they might bee eaſilie put to the ſwoord, whereby the aſſaylants might bee ſo much weakened. Beſides that, hee was at the poynt to haue receiued ſome good ſome of money. Heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon the ſeuenteenth and eighteenth day of Ianuarie, there came in diuers of the companies of <hi>Puigaillard</hi> and of
<hi>Martin,</hi> ſurnamed the <hi>Lutherian:</hi> but the Maior conferring with foure or fiue of the principall, in their reſolution found it better to performe ſome ſmall aſſured execution, then to aduenture vpon any dangerous enterpriſe, &amp; therefore without further delay, thought it good to ridde thoſe that were alreadie entered, and not to ſtay vntill either they had gathered more ſtrength, or corrupted others. Of theſe traitors al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie inrolled into one of the companies, fiue were ſlain the ſame night, and their bodies caſt ouer the wals beneath the new gate, and three were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to priſon, who after they had diſcloſed the particularities, paſſed the Hangmans hands.</p>
               <p>Thencefoorth the Rochelers ſpent ſome daies in burning ſuch farmes, houſes, and milles without their towne, as to their annoyance might haue ſtood the aſſaylants in great ſtead.
<note place="margin">A pleaſant aduenture</note> The Towne had beſtowed vpon Captaine <hi>Normand</hi> a certaine mill ſtanding very neare, whereof hee tooke ſome ſmall rent, for the preſeruing all that might bee woorth the taking in the ſaid Mill. There did <hi>Normand</hi> in the night leaue one ſouldier. Thither came the aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants with the choiſe of their footemen, the three and twentieth daie of Ianu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie, and brought two coluerings to force the ſame, which by moone-light they planted verie neare, and diſcharged ſixteene ſhot. The ſouldier likewiſe diſcharhed ſome ſmall ſhot, whervpon his Captain hearing the alarme came to the rampier on that ſide, and called to his ſouldier, as if there had bin ſome number in the Mill: Courage good fellowes, courage, yeeld not, yee ſhall haue helpe by and by.</p>
               <p>But at the laſt this ſouldier craued parley, and compounded for all that were in the Mill: howbeit when the enemies perceiued that hee was alone, and ſpiting at his reſoluteneſſe, they kept him priſoner, and afterward ſeeing him vnable to pay the ranſome that they deſired, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded to ſend him to the Gallies: but being powled and in his ſlauiſh attire, hee found meanes to eſcape, and ſo returned ſafe into the Towne.</p>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:22081:140"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>La Noue</hi> they choſe for their Captain in armes, without preiudice to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iors liberties and authoritie in all other matters.<note place="margin">La Noue made Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the warres in Rochel.</note> They alſo ſent new Deputies into England for ſuccour, which the king hindered in all that he could. And among all other deuiſes, hee cauſed the Queene of England, with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, and the Duke of
<hi>Sauoy,</hi> to chriſten his daughter, who being borne the ſeuen and twentieth day of October, was baptized the ſecond of Februarie, and died young.</p>
               <p>The Earle of <hi>VVorceſter</hi> addicted to the Romiſh religion, comming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France</hi> about this ceremonie, had like to haue been robbed by certaine ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, who ſlaying ſome of his men, rifeled one of his ſhippes, but there vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſuch French and Wallons as could be caught in any Engliſh Hauen, ſped but euill fauoredly. The daily skirmiſhes continued between the Rochelers and their enemies, wherein as wel the ſufficiencie of the leaders,<note place="margin">Continuall ſkirmiſhes.</note> as the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the Souldiers did euidently appeare, yet not to the hurt of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Catholicques, againſt whom their enemies made many proſperous ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, beeing alwaies prouided of a neare and ſure retrait. In the beginning of Februarie, the Duke of <hi>Aniou,</hi> Generall of the armie royall, beeing come to Saint <hi>Maixant,</hi> ſent his letters to <hi>la Noue,</hi> to ſummon him to deliuer vppe <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> with promiſe of life and goods: withall importing, that if within three daies after his appoynted arriuall in his campe, this were not performed, he was reſolued with his whole forces as well in camped, as to come after him, not to linger any minute, but to beſiege the Towne, to force it, and ſo to puniſh thoſe that ſhould be taken, that their execution might bee an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to all others. Now did the Rochelers beginne better to conſider of the defenſiue, and to labour about their fortifications: but becauſe the campe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually hindered their men from cutting and bringing in of faggots and other conuenient ſtuffe, <hi>La Noue</hi> informed of their ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>des, vpon the ſixt of Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie layd an ambuſh both of horſe and foote ſo fitly, that ſuffering their skirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers to come well forward, hee incloſed them between his troupes and the towne, and then cut in peeces all that were ſo inſnared. Beſides, not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, hee ſet vppon the lodging of Captaine <hi>Portes</hi> companie, where he ſlew ſixtie ſouldiers, &amp; without loſſe of any more then one, that day he returned with fortie priſoners, who the next day were ſent backe without ranſome, in regard that al the mony that wold be made of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, would neuer counteruaile their expe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces for a few daies: yet ſuch as were found to be murtherers, were woorſe entreated. In the towne there were at that time a good number of Gentlemen &amp; horſemen: eight companies of the Inhabitants, nine of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, beſides the Maiors companie, and one of <hi>Voluntaries,</hi> formed by <hi>la No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue,</hi> and conſiſting of twentie Muskettiers, fiftie fiue Pike-men, each in his corcelot at proofe, and 30. harguebuziers: of this companie two parts were Gentlemen, and ſuch as had born office in the wars. The D. of <hi>Aniou</hi> arriued within 7. leagues of <hi>Rochel,</hi> wrote vnto the Nobilitie &amp; Inhabitants two let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, dated the 10. of Feb. wherin he exhorted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to yeeld,<note place="margin">A notable ſkirmiſh.

Herevnto did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Rochelers anſwer in al humilitie, declaring the neceſsitie of their defenſiue, &amp; intreating the D. to prouide for the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realm, &amp; to take ſuch order, that they might ſerue God in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, their anſwer imported, that albeit they were affected to the kings ſeruice, yet that through the malice of flatteres &amp; <pb n="280" facs="tcp:22081:141"/>as could brooke no peace, they were brought into his diſgrace: withall, they ſhewed a reaſon for their taking of armes, which was not voluntarie, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie that inforced them thereto, as finding no better meanes to preſerue both ſpirituall and temporall, but to retire into the Forts &amp; places of defence, their liues, vntil it might pleaſe the king to take ſome order by a lawful aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Eſtates and generall Councels.</p>
               <p>They alſo beſought the Duke of <hi>Aniou</hi> to conſider of their iuſt complaints, and not to impute vnto them that which proceeded of other mens faults, and ſo offered to the king and him all obedience and ſeruice. The next day the Duke arriued in the campe, accompanied with his brother the Duke of <hi>Alen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi> the king of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Dauphine,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueuille, Bouillon, Neuers, Aumale,</hi> and <hi>Guiſe,</hi> the young Countie of

This one thing ſtood the Rochelers in good ſtead, that in the enemies Councell they had many heads, that ſhewed as many and diuers imagations and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</p>

Beeing come, I wondred to finde there ſo many people of ſo diuers humours, that would haue been loth it ſhould haue been taken.</p>
               <p>The ſiege was great, long, and gallant, well aſſaulted, and better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. I will not ſtand to write all that was there done: for I was but one, neither will I ſpeake hardly of any. <hi>Monſieur,</hi> who after was king, and was General in that ſiege, ſo far honouring me, as to vſe ſome conference, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to gather my aduiſe, knoweth well ynough I told him frankly what I thought. This ſiege may teach all that were then preſent, or that ſhal come heereafter, that in thoſe daies, Towns of ſuch importance muſt betaken by famine and incloſing: by little &amp; little. One great ouerſight was there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and that was the aduenturing of ſo many men in the aſſaults: and a greater in keeping ſo bad watch to keepe the towne from ſuccour of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which came in by ſea.</p>
               <p>For to ſay my minde as others, whatſoeuer ſhift the Rochelers could haue made, wee had had them, they cannot denie it: I ſay with the halters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their neckes: for the ſuccours that the Countie
<hi>Montgommery</hi> brought, was retired, and wee readie to buckle with them: for all things failed them: but at the ſame time my brother the B. of
<hi>Valence</hi> was in <hi>Poland,</hi> to procure the election of
<hi>Monſieur</hi> for their King, which hee archieued, and the glorie thereof I thinke due to him alone: but that cauſed all men to thinke vpon ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation, which at the laſt was compaſſed. The Polonians Deputies came thither to ſalute him for their king. All the troupes retired, and leauing many dead, and the Rochelers Lords of their Towne, prepared to come to the feaſt of this new Crowne.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Monſieurs</hi> ſpeeches, at his departure it ſeemed he had no great liking of this kingdome, yet do I thinke it was a great honour to him and vs, that ſo <pb n="281" facs="tcp:22081:141"/>remote a kingdome ſhould ſeeke a king from vs. This is <hi>Monlucs</hi> iudgement.

                  </gap>he aſſailants from the Carraque diſcharged many cannon ſhot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Towne and ſtraight, in caſe any veſſell offered to paſſe in the night or miſtes: but of many hundreths, none took, either to kil or hurt, except ſome two or three perſons. The 23. day of February, after many conſultations and meſſages, the Lords of <hi>Byron, Stroſſy, Villequier,</hi> and the Abbot of <hi>Gadaigne,</hi> held a parley at <hi>Coignes</hi> gate, with <hi>la Noue</hi> the Lieftenant generall, <hi>Mortiers</hi> and <hi>Moriſſon</hi> Deputies for <hi>Rochel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Abbot diſcourſed of the kings intent and clemencie: alleaging that heereafter there would bee no hope to mooue him by any intreatie or praier: that hee had done more then beſeemed his greatneſſe: that all other his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of the religion would thinke themſelues happie, if they might obtaine but halfe of that hee offered to the Rochelers: and ſo exhorted the Deputies well to conſider of it, and not to let ſlip ſuch an occaſion. <hi>La Noue</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three, giuing their aduiſe as particular perſons, anſwered: that as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their commiſsion, it extended onely to receiue ſuch articles as the king ſhould ſend: to take notice of <hi>Gadaignes</hi> authoritie, and to referre the whole to the Councell of the Town, which was compoſed of one hundreth men, Sheriffes, and Peeres, whereof the Maior was chiefe. The ſame time the Duke of
<hi>Aniou</hi> cauſed Captaine <hi>Cadet,</hi> a Turke by nation, to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted at at <hi>Nieul,</hi> for the manifold robberies and ſpoyles whereof hee was conuict, albeit many great Lords and Captaines laboured mightily for his life, whom the D. denied, and therefore of all good men was well thought of, and feared of the wicked.</p>
               <p>The articles which <hi>Gadaigne</hi> deliuered, in number ſeuen and twentie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uined a proteſtation of the kings ſinceritie, both in the olde and new profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt the Admirall, whoſe remembrance written with his owne hand (neuer before ſpoken of) were then alleaged. Next, he ſummonned the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelers to open their gates to <hi>Biron,</hi> or any other that ſhould haue commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to enter their Towne as they ought: (that is to ſay, with ſuch troupes as hee ſhould thinke ſufficient) to maintain the authoritie royall, and to take order that it might come no more in the hands of ſeditious perſons.

               <p>Three daies after this parley, the Rochelers vnderſtanding of two and thirtie battering peeces within halfe a league of them, withall, that their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ment to skirmiſh after dinner, and to emptie their forces, reſolued alſo to do ſomewhat, and ſo ſallied about noone.

In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of march, for three or foure daies togither, they had many parleyes, to the end to get the Towne without fight.</p>
               <p>They offered the exerciſe of religion in the Towne, which was aboliſhed in all other Townes of <hi>France:</hi> and the Duke of
<hi>Aniou</hi> conceiuing the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour out of England to be but a vaine imagination, ſpake more ſharpely then euer before. The day before,

               <p>The fift of March, the whole Councell of the Towne was aſſembled, wherin after ſundrie opinions, it was reſolued that they ſhuld abide al extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to yeeld to any vnreaſonable demand: alſo that they ſhuld ſend no more Deputies, but returne their anſwere by a drumme.

Sixe or ſeuen daies after, the batterie beeing againe begunne and continued,
<hi>la Noue</hi> finding his preſence to be vnprofitable to the Rochelers, vppon diuers occaſions withdrew from them, and departed to the Dukes campe with <hi>Champagny, la Roche Eſnard, la Salle,</hi>

               <p>In this months ſpace, the enemie diſcharged aboue thirteene thouſand cannon ſhotte, beſides ſundries skirmiſhes and ſurpriſes, wherein the aſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants ſtill had the woorſt, who in a few weekes loſt aboue twentie Captains.

Foure daies after, about

               <p>The batterie hauing continued the ſixe firſt daies of Aprill, the ſeuenth day about ſix of the clocke in the morning, beganne more fierce then before, and with ſuch violence, that along wall from the olde fountaine to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel bulwarcke was layd flat: the bulwarcke diſmanteled, &amp; the <hi>Cognee</hi> tower the aſſaylants came to the aſſault, caſt a bridge ouer the ditch, which they ſtretched euen beaten downe.<note place="margin">The firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault.</note> Towards fiue of the clocke at night againſt the bulwarcke, and tooke two Caſemates, which they held but a ſmall while: for with one cannon ſhot into the Caſemates, ſome were ſlaine, others being ſpeedily charged by reſolute ſouldiers, were in part cut in peeces, and the reſt ſaued themſelues by flight.</p>
               <p>During this conflict in the Caſemates, the enemie came forward cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly ouer their wooden bridge, with two hundreth targets and corce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, who were as valiantly withſtood by the beſieged, notwithſtanding the cannon plaied continually, which ſlew fifteen of their men, and hurt diuers. This notwithſtanding the women and Maidens deuoide of al feare, as if they had neither ſeene nor heard any thing, ranne reſolutely vp and down caſting out their ſcalding water, circles, ſtones, and ſuch like, which ſlewe diuers aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaylants, who were forced to forſake the ditch with the loſſe of diuers Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, Gentlemen and ſouldiers.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The ſecond aſſault.</note>The next day about nine of the clocke in the morning, they came to the ſecond aſſault, which was valiantly ſuſtained by the Rochelers: and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies forced to retire into their trenches.

The tenth of Aprill by ſixe of the clocke in the morning, the enemie returned with great furie to aſſault the aforenamed bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke, as alſo at the gate of the two mils, there appeared a great number wel ſtored with lathers: likewiſe towards

               <p>As for thoſe that brought the lathers, they had leiſure ynough to reare them, and to climbe vp: but ſo ſoone as they were vp, the Townſmen ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw them with ſuch force and actiuitie with pikes and hallebardes, and in ſuch number, that breaking armes, legs, and heads in the ditch, their fellows were forced to giue ouer and flie in ſuch ſort, that ſome caſt themſelues into the fennes, which the women had taken to keepe, who with fire-forkes and ſpits made an end of the wounded &amp; ſtripped them.

The beſieged were ſhrewdly annoyed with the cannon, which ouerthrew the fore-part of the bulwarke, that ſlew many of their ſouldiers, and hurt others, to the number of fiftie, yet the aſſaylants loſt more, namely one of their Captaines. But the next day they began againe to beate moſt fiercely, and about fiue of the clock at night, they blew vp their firſt myne at the baſtion or bulwarke of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: and withall, gaue a moſt fierce aſſault, which they ſtil renued fiue times on a row,<note place="margin">The fift aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault fiue times renued</note> where they had as friendly entertainment as in the reſt with great loſſe, beſides three hundreth men caught in their mine, which played cleane contrary to their expectation, and fell eſpecially vppon themſelues. Two daies after, about eleuen of the clocke at night, the beſieged made a ſallie, ſlew a great number of men, and carried into the Towne great ſtore of murrians, cuiraces, partuiſans, halbards, and courtelaſſes: and burned a wodden bridge: in reuenge whereof, the enemie diſcharged certaine cannon ſhorte, which with the breaking of the ſtones hurt fiue or ſixe: beſides Captaine <hi>Muſſe,</hi> who had don great ſeruice in that ſiege, was that day ſo wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with three ſmall ſhot, that hee died ſoone after.</p>

The next day before ſunne riſing, their ordinance played vppon the Bulwarke, and toward eleuen of the clocke they redoubled their batterie: beſides, their troupes came in on all ſides:<note place="margin">The ſeuenth.</note> yea euen out of their Carriques and Gallies they ſhot luſtily, which cauſed euery man to runne to armes: namely, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with mens hartes on their heads, marched in haſte with pikes, halbards, and Iauelins in their hands, fully reſolued rather to die in the place, then to ſuffer the enemie to enter.</p>
               <p>The aſſault continued fiue houres, wherein the defendants loſt ſome twelue or fifteene men, beſides fiue and twentie or thirtie wounded: but the aſſaylants a great number in the firſt charge, ſo as they durſt no more come in ſmall troupes: and the moſt reſolute retired, becauſe the companie of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Bobineau</hi> a Rocheler, garding the Caſemates neare the bulwarke that flangued iuſt vpon the enemies bridge did mightily annoy them, as beeing within two pikes length each of other.</p>
               <p>The nine and twentieth of the moneth, the beſieged made a ſallie, where in a Caſemat that they forced, and in part diſcouered, they ſlew a great number.</p>
               <p>The ſame day the Maior ſent to the Duke of <hi>Aniou,</hi> the articles which the Rochelers, with the Gentlemen and ſouldiers ſtraungers deſired to be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, whereof they had aunſwere ſix daies after, beſides ſundrie vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable parleyes. All this was done about the beginning of May, of what time the Polonians elected the Duke of
<hi>Aniou</hi> to bee their king: for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates accepted of him the ninth of May, vppon which day the Rochelers, who from the 7. aſſault had neuer miſſed either night or day to giue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemie ſome foyle, made aſallie through the countermine of the Goſpell bulwarke <pb n="285" facs="tcp:22081:143"/>where they ſurpriſed thoſe that were next at hand, ſlew ſome pioners, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thirtie ſouldiers, and carried away foure priſoners, without any loſſe on their ſide.</p>
               <p>The next day at tenne of the clocke at night, about foure hundreth ſmal ſhot, and fiftie horſe, ſallied foorth at <hi>Maubec</hi> gate, and neare to <hi>Cognee</hi> gate ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed a corps degard, and with the loſſe of one horſeman ſlew fortie or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the ſloweſt.

               <p>The ſame day toward fiue of the clocke at night, the Sarreant Maior of the Towne made a ſallie, and fired part of their wodden bridge, and foure and twentie houres after, returned to burne the corps degard that was hard by the ſald bridge.

                  <note place="margin">A notable ſallie.</note>Three daies after, ſome foure or fiue hundreth men after noone ſallied foorth of the towne, and ſurpriſed and mightily amazed the enemie that lay toward the

The whole campe taking the alarm, many came in, ſo that the Rochelers loſt 20. of their men, but carried into their towne eight Enſignes with many cuiraces, Halbards, Targets, Harguebuzes &amp; guilt ſwords. They did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bewaile <hi>Maronniere,</hi> a braue Gentleman, who died of his wounds within two daies after, as a little before they had done the death of <hi>Vergerbeanlieu,</hi> a Poeteuine Gentleman, highly eſteemed for his valour, whereof be had made proofe, eſpecially in the eight aſſault, where hee tooke his deadly wound. The fiue and twentieth day of May, the batterie beganne very furious, and laſted till nine: the reaſon was, that fiue mynes which the enemie had dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, were ſhut and readie to play.</p>
               <p>The next morning by breake of day, the batterie beganne againe as wel againe the bulwarke, as againſt the defences, and ſo continued vntill night. The next morning about ſeuen of the clocke, all the companies of the campe <pb n="286" facs="tcp:22081:144"/>were muſtered. The Switzers being new come, to the number of 16. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes in a great battaillon, were by the Rochelers welcommed with cannon ſhort, which fell ſo iuſt among them, that they made a great lane, and forced the reſt to go further from the Towne.</p>
               <p>About eleuen of the clocke, the regiments of the campe beeing readie to the aſſault, diſcharging their artillerie blew vp their mynes, wherein reſted their whole hope,<note place="margin">The ninth aſſault.</note> but all this ſtood them in no ſtead: for ſome of their mines did greatly helpe to fortifie the beſieged, and to flancke the breach from the olde fountaine to the Goſpel-bulwarke: a fatall and vnhappie name for the enemie, who were expected and repulſed by the women, maides, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, who that day did incredible things. The aſſault was fiue times renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and laſted vntill ſixe of the clocke at night, alwaies more fierce and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then any of the former. And indeed the enemie loſt foure hundreth men that ſtayed in the ditches, and carried away ſixe hundreth wounded. The Rochelers loſt thirtie or fortie ſouldiers and women, and three or foure Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines: among the reſt, one very valiant, named
<hi>Blays,</hi> who was ſlaine with a peece of a ſtone.</p>
               <p>The Countie <hi>Montgommery</hi> did his endeuour to ſuccour the Rochelers by ſea, but in vaine, in that he was ouerweake both in ſhipping and men, to fight with the fleet royall,<note place="margin">Murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings in Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell.</note> which was verie ſtrong. Towards the beginning of Iune, victualles beganne to grow ſhort with the beſieged: wherevppon ſome conſidering that the enemies cannon plaied continually, alſo that ſome ſouldiers fledde the Towne, began to doubt and haue ſome ſpeech of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, ſo that ſome of the moſt apparant were impriſoned, for that togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſome three hundreth, they had ſigned a bill that imported the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of peace vpon whatſoeuer conditions: for their parts, they were weary of the warres, and the great want of corne would ſhortly breede a famine. Others had in open ſtreet conſulted vppon taking of the gates, whereby to go foorth at their pleaſures. Of theſe murmures enſued new parleyes, which the Duke of <hi>Aniou</hi> ſolicited, that ſo hee might depart thence: for the newes was come that he was choſen king of

               <p>In the meane time, vpon Fryday the twelfth of Iune, the enemie gaue a ſuddaine eſcalado at the little breach neare to the old fountaine, ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth, or ſixſcore Gentlemen gat vppe, and ſome vnto the Caualier, where they ſtayed long ynough to take a view of the inward trenches and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarpe, that was fortified within the retrenchment, and ſo beganne to retire neither eſcaped they al the greeting of the ſmal ſhot, which diminiſhed their number, and ſlew ſome fifteene or twentie in the place. The next day they returned to their parleyes, and becauſe the Rochelers had counſell to ſend their Deputies to the Duke of
<hi>Aniou,</hi> at whoſe hands (as they were told) they might obtaine more then they demaunded, they ſtayed for a paſport, which they found ſo badly penned, that they might well perceiue that it ſtood them vppon to beware, and therefore they cauſed their Deputies to retire, which ſo netled the D. that he reſolued before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the Polonian Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors to trie all meanes: and to the ſame end, came in perſon to take a view of the mine by the old fountaine,<note place="margin">The Duke of Anious aduentures.</note> where one of the Towne ſouldiers diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him, ſhot off a harguebuze charged with a bullet and ſome haile ſhot: <pb n="287" facs="tcp:22081:144"/>but his great Eſquier named <hi>Deuin,</hi> perceiuing the match, ſtepped before him and was ſlaine: the Duke reſerued to an other end, was ſlightly touched with ſome of the haile ſhot, but not hurt. After this, notwithſtanding their ſhooting and ſallying on both ſides, yet was it nothing in regard of that which was paſt. But vpon the 17. of Iune, the Poliſh Ambaſſadors being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued in <hi>France,</hi> truce was made, and laſtly the articles of peace agreed vpon and ſent vnto the king, which hee approoued, and framed them in manner of an Edict, graunting to thoſe of the religion, <hi>Rochel, Montauban, Niſmes,</hi> and other Townes, wherein the free exerciſe of religion was permitted: and to others, permiſsion to liue without trouble in their houſes,<note place="margin">An Edict of pacification, for Rochell and all thoſe of the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> therein to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnize baptiſme and marriage after their manner, without greater aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſides the Parents, then the number of tenne: except in the Court at

               <p>And by vertue of this Edict, vpon the tenth of Iuly, about tenne of the clocke in the morning, <hi>Monſieur de Biron</hi> entered into the Towne at <hi>Coigne</hi> gate, with a Herauld at armes, and four of the kings trumpets: at which time hee cauſed the peace to bee publiſhed in the principall places, accompanied by the Lieftenant of the Towne, and of

               <p>The beſieged hauing performed all that was to be deſired in valiant men, in Aprill did accept of compoſition for life and goods, and ſo the Marſhall ſending hoſtages to <hi>Niſmes</hi> for their ſafetie, they came foorth with the drum ſounding, the Enſignes diſplayed, their matches lighted and in the cock, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſeuen daies reſpite to carrie away their goods, and to retire where they liſt.

Their new king was not greatly deſirous to make that long perigrination, and would gladly haue ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till the next Sommer: and ſome of his moſt truſtie friends aſſayed to cauſe ſome hard anſwere to bee giuen vnto the Ambaſſadors, to the end that either they ſhould returne diſcontented, or that the time might by that means paſſe away. But the kings ſeruants cauſed him to make faire promiſes to thoſe Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors that were remitted vnto the Towne of <hi>Metz,</hi> there to vnderſtand what or how much ſhould bee done for them.</p>
               <p>Among theſe ſerious matters, the King could not content himſelfe, but twiſe or thriſe caſt out certaine threatning words againſt thoſe that had abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, making him beleeue that after the foure and twentieth day of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, hee ſhould bee abſolute king.

               <p>And being ſomewhat amended and recouered of his ſtrength, he ceaſed not to procure and haſten his brothers departure, that iſſued out of <hi>France</hi> about the end of October, leauing all the charge vnto his mother, who openly ſhewed to beare him greater affection then to her other two ſonnes.

               <p>On the other ſide, the Queene-mother fained to bee verie carefull tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the election of the Lieftenant generall of the Realme.

Therevppon newes came, that the Deputies of diuers Prouinces came from many places to aſſemble the eſtates, with notes and commiſsions to ſpeake boldly, namely againſt the Authors and Councellours of the maſſacres. For which cauſe the eſtates beeing aſsigned to bee at <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne,</hi> was reiourned, and yet diuers Deputies beeing come to <hi>Parris,</hi> asked and obtained audience, wherein after many and diuers ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt complaints and declarations made touching the publicque con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions of the Realme of

               <p>The miſchiefe by the which an entrie was made for the ruine and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of thoſe of the religion, was, that diuers Catholickes that termed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Certaine polliticque Courtiers to bring the matter to a better poynt, eſteemed it neceſſarie to haue a Lieftenant generall, nominating the D. of <hi>Alencon</hi> as moſt fit for that place: they ſet before him the little eſtimation made of him: his ſmall meanes: the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions made of his ſeruants: the diſtruſts that were had touching his fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: the refuſall of graunting him the Lieftenancie generall: the kings ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the meanes that offered it ſelfe vnto him to reſtore the eſtate of the Realme, counſelling him to withdraw himſelfe from the Court, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to mooue the matter.</p>

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Alencon,</hi> that had been ſolicited by his moſt faithfull Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours to looke vnto himſelfe, was put in minde to ſeeke for the place of Lieftenant generall, and if hee obtained it to keepe himſelfe aloofe: or if they ſought to imploy him againſt thoſe of

               <p>Before hee diſlodged happened an other matter: the Duke of

               <p>This deuile thus wrought: the Marſhall being a wiſe Gentleman, fought to finde out the trueth, and cauſed <hi>Ventabran</hi> to be committed to priſon, who within two daies after, was ſet at libertie, which was the occaſion that the Marſhall by licence from the king departed from the Court.

Time made knowne what fell out thereby: but whatſoeuer it was, the Prince arriued at <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> and hauing acknowledged his fault in the French Church, there aſſembled touching his conuerſion after the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre to the Popiſh Church, hee deteſted it, reſoluing to imploy himſelfe to maintaine the eſtate of <hi>France,</hi> as his father had done, and there finding the Deputies of <hi>Languedoc</hi> practiſing a leuie of Rutters, wrote vnto the churches, exhorting thoſe of the religion to bee couragious, and to make account of his good will for their comforts.</p>
               <p>By the ſame meſſenger <hi>Thore</hi> writ to his brother the Marſhall <hi>d'Anuille,</hi> perſwading him to looke about him, and to take the offered occaſion.

               <p>Heerevppon hee reſolued ſometimes to haue an eye to the Court, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the contrarie, and according to the Prouerb, to watch how the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket went. On the one ſide writing to the chiefe Captaines of the proteſtants: on the other, ſending the Lord of <hi>Rieux</hi> to <hi>Boisde Vincennes</hi> to the king, with ample inſtructions dated the eighteenth of May, therein proteſting of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: declaring his former ſeruices, intreating after account yeelded of his adminiſtration to bee diſcharged of his office, and to withdraw to any place that the king ſhould appoynt. The ſame day hee wrote to the Parliament of <hi>Thoulouſe,</hi> to excuſe himſelfe of that he was accuſe of a deſire to rebel againſt the king, and to ſurpriſe <hi>Narbonne.</hi> Theſe proceedings ſtayed the Queene-mother and her Councellours, who did well perceiue that

                  <note place="margin">The kings ſickneſſe.</note>The ſickneſſe wherewith the king was troubled, not long before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of his brother to go into <hi>Poland,</hi> had a little reſt for the winter time, but the hidden diſeaſe about ſpring time beganne againe to reuiue, in ſuch ſort, that hauing bin ſicke in the months of February, March, and Aprill, hee was counſelled by his Phiſitians, that hee ſhould bee purged and let blood, which were meanes altogither vnprofitable, becauſe it was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly ſeene, that hee began to fade euen in the flower of his age, to the great aſtoniſhing of the ignorant.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of leaſt iudgement, eſteemed that hee had eaten or drunke ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that diſieſted not. Some ſuperſtitious perſons imagined ſome witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafe or coniuratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; becauſe <hi>la Mole</hi> had bin found ſeized with a litle image of wax about him, (which he affirmed to be the picture of a Gentlewoman) <pb n="301" facs="tcp:22081:152"/>pricked in two places by a witch, they made certaine reports to be ſpredde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, that it was a certain charme vſed againſt the life of the king.

               <p>The king vſed all the meanes hee could to ſurmount and ouercome his ſickneſſe, and as his yeares gaue him, aſſayed diuers times to ſhewe his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, but all in vaine. After the departure of the king of <hi>Polonia,</hi> they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him to bee more changed in minde then in bodie. If he had liued longer, it is without all doubt, that the Councellours of the maſſacre had receiued their reward from him, his heart was ſo much mooued againſt them, ſo that he could not chuſe but vtter his mind therin to ſome about him in the Court, whom hee knew to bee vtter enemies to ſuch iniuſtice: and thereof wrote letters out of the Realme. So that to conclude, hee was determined to haue made ſome ſtirring among them, vntill that finding himſelfe to bee ſeized vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, and that hee had not the meanes as then to execute any thing, beeing inuironed by men that helde him as it were bound both hand and foote, his ſeruants ſlaine, diſgraced, or baniſhed from him: wherein in time he thought to take order, that might procure an ouerture to his haughtie deſires, not once thinking vntill hee was ſo weake, that hee had beene ſo neare his death.</p>

                  <note place="margin">His letters to the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces.</note>In the end of March, hee wrote vnto the Gouernours of the Prouinces, ſaying, that ſeeing the diſcontentment of his ſubiects, and the common cauſe of the religion, produced ſo many troubles within his Realme, hee deſired them to vſe peaceable meanes with thoſe of the religion, declaring that hee would not that any wrong ſhould be done vnto them, nor other dealing v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed towards them in their affaires, then the other Catholicque ſubiects of his Realme: hee commaunded that thoſe of the religion ſhould bee ſafegarded by thoſe of the Romiſh Church, to aſſure &amp; defend them from the violence that was to be done againſt them: where any ſuch ſhould bee enterpriſed, hee commaunded all his Officers, to vſe the ſpeedieſt and readieſt iuſtice that might bee, willing them to looke vnto it, calling God to witneſſe, that his onely intent was, to ſee all his ſubiects liue in peace. Hee likewiſe deſired the ſame Gouernours to prouide, that their companies ſhould not in any ſort bee chargeable to their ſubiects, but ſhould paye according to the order therein taken: by the ſame letter alſo ſhewing, that hee had been ſicke of a quarterne ague, hee was as then ſomewhat recouered, ſo that the reports ſpred abroad of his death, were wholy vntrueths.</p>
               <p>The fourth of May, hee aduertiſed the ſaid Gouernors of the impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the two Marſhals, that were accuſed of conſpiracie againſt his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and the eſtate, inioyning them to ouerrunne all thoſe that were vppe in armes, to put them to the ſword, but the poore Prince as then was neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected of friends nor enemies. Euery day he receiued packets of new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, that bredde nothing but diſcommodities, wherein a firme peace, and faithfull maintenance of thoſe of the religion in the exerciſe thereof, and in that which they had deſired for the conſeruations of their perſons, goods, dignities, rights, and priuiledges, had beene the onely remedie which his mother and her Councellours abhorred.</p>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:22081:153"/>
               <p>Hee perceiued the beginnings of new troubles, in the captiuitie of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his brother in law, and the two Marſhals: as alſo in the exile of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and of diuers great Lords: his ſubiects armed one againſt the other: and to bee ſhort, the fire of diuiſion kindled more then euer it was.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon ouercome with the euill that raigned in his bodie, and with ſo many horrible tempeſts in his brains, he was forced to keepe his bed and yeelde to his diſeaſe. For the ſpace of certaine daies hee ſtroue and ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geled againſt nature, not yeelding therevnto by extreame force. The nine and twentieth of May, letters were written in his name to the Gouernours of Prouinces, to whom hee ſent word, that during his ſickneſſe if he chanced to die, vntil the comming of the king of
<hi>Polonia</hi> his brother &amp; ſucceſſor, they ſhould obey the Queene his mother,<note place="margin">Letters in fauour of his mother.</note> whatſoeuer ſhee would commaund: ſhewing that his bretheren the Duke of

               <p>The thirtieth of May, which was the day of his death, the Queene-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perceiuing that the ſimple letters made the day before,<note place="margin">The day of his death, &amp; what paſſed as then ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally touching the regency.</note> touching the charge to her committed, ſufficed not to ſtrengthen her authoritie during the abſence of the king of
<hi>Polonia,</hi> whom ſhee feared could not ſo ſoone returne againe into
<hi>France,</hi> determined for his ſure eſtabliſhment, to cauſe her ſelfe to bee declared Regent in the abſence of the king to come, and to cauſe letters pattents thereof to bee ſealed by the Chancellour
<hi>Birague,</hi> who with the ſeales was wholly at her commaundement: which was as much as to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw &amp; ſubuert the fundamentall lawes of the Realme, to aboliſh the right of the firſt Prince of the blood, to leſſen the authoritie of the eſtates generall, to rule the Parliaments, and to raigne in ſtraunge manner ouer <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>The king that was at his laſt houre, by their aduiſe cauſed the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Captaines of his guards to bee called in, to whom hee ſaide: Doo all that which the Queene my mother ſhall commaund you, and obey her as my ſelfe. The Duke of <hi>Alencon</hi> and the King of

One that publiſhed a diſcourſe of his laſt ſpeechs, ſaith, that not long before hee died, hee deſired his mother to purſue his enemies to the vttermoſt, and that with great vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie he reiterated his ſpeeches, ſaying: Madame, I pray you heartily do it. And in thoſe combats of minde, hee died at <hi>Blois</hi> Saint <hi>Vincennes,</hi> vpon the
30. of May, 1574. in the preſence of his mother, ſet vpon a cheſt, accompanied with the Cardinals of <hi>Bourbon</hi> &amp; <hi>Ferrare,</hi> the Chancellor <hi>Birague, Lanſac,</hi> &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lords that beheld y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of the tragical life of this Prince, that was born the 27. of Iune 1550. &amp; began to raigne the 5. of Decemb. 1560, and had a raigne which all poſteritie will admire and abhorre. So this Prince liued not till hee attained to the full age of foure and twentie yeares, of nature beeing very actiue, vnconſtant in his cogitations, raſh in his enterpriſes, impatient to attend, diligent to looke into other mens natures, prompt of conceit, of good memorie, extreame colloricke, ſecret, a great diſſembler, and one that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily framed his countenance,<note place="margin">Deſcription of Charles the ninth.</note> which his Tutors many times put him in minde of, for in the beginning hee was courteous, and eaſie to bee ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
               <p>They likewiſe made him become one of the greateſt blaſphemers in <hi>France,</hi> wherein he became ſo expert, that that euill quallitie in him, conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bee his ordinarie ſpeech.
<hi>Martigues, Loſſes</hi> and others, taught him that corruption by his mothers conſent: ſpecially after the firſt troubles. They contented not themſelues with thoſe corruptions, but inticed him likewiſe to Courtizans, to whom of himſelf he was not much adicted: and to conclude, to make him the capitall enemie of the religion, both ſhee and they which ought to haue had more care of conſeruing the honour of this Prince, left nothing omitted, wherby to puſh him forward to all vice, &amp; to cauſe him to wallow in the filthineſſe that couered him on all ſides: hee vttered his words in good termes, with a readie and pleaſant ſpeech: loued Muſicke and Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: wee haue ſeene reaſonable good verſes of his compoſing. But his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall exerciſe was in hunting, the pleaſure whereof, made him forget all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleaſures, and in the end hee gaue himſelfe ſo much vnto it, that the blood of wilde beaſts, which to ſhed hee tooke a ſingular pleaſure, hauing ript vp their bellies, &amp; pulling out their intrailes with his owne hands, made him in a manner to become furious, ſo that many times at his returne from hunting, hee entered into ſuch furie, that none of his ſeruants durſt once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in his ſight, vnleſſe would receiue ſome blows. In his Anagranome, which was deuiſed by certaine perſons after the maſſacre, was found out theſe two words:
<hi>Chaſſeur, Deſloyal,</hi> wherein are as many letters, and the ſame that are in <hi>Charles de Valois.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hee had compoſed a booke of all the parts of bunting, which till this time neuer was extant: hee was ſober, drinking no wine, ſlept little: his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage long, pale, and ſwart: a long noſe: ſharpe and quicke ſight, ſpecially after the ſecond troubles: of bodie well proportioned, but beginning to ſtoupe. Hee tooke pleaſure to taunt great men, not ſparing either mother or brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, ſpecially the Duke of
<hi>Aniou,</hi> whom hee railed at, and diuers times vſed him moſt vnwoorthily: but aboue all, hee had a great quarrell to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of
<hi>Parris:</hi> to the officers whereof, in one of his Orations made tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the complaints of the neglecting of his commaundements, hee ſaid:
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:22081:154"/>I will that from hencefoorth you ſhall obey my commaundement, without any more diſputation touching their merites, for I know what is to bee done for the honour and profite of my realme, better then you do. And I will that from hencefoorth you ſhall not looſe any time to write, or frame your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration vnto mee, neither yet to moderate, correct, nor interpret my commaundements. For my meaning is, that all whatſoeuer I ſay and do, ſhal preſently bee executed. Three daies before hee died, his mother hauing ſhewed him of the taking of the Countie <hi>de Montgommery,</hi> hee made her no aunſwere: and when ſhee told him that hee ought to reioyce at the taking of him that had killed his father, I care neither for that (ſaid hee) nor for any thing elſe in this world.</p>
               <p>Hee likewiſe reioyced that hee left no ſmall children behinde him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (ſaid he) that leauing them in their minorities, they ſhould haue ouer much to ſuffer: adding, that <hi>France</hi> as then had neede of a man. Now wee muſt ſpeake of his ſucceſſour, and ſee what maner of man hee was.</p>

He is a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, from his Grandfathers in both families, and not onely a meere Frenchman, but on his fathers ſide, of the firſt branch of the blood royall: the like on his mothers ſide; by his father, not onely deſcended from Saint <hi>Lewis,</hi> or <hi>Hugh Capet,</hi> but from
<hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Dagobert,</hi> of whom the <hi>Capets</hi> deſcended, contrarie to the wilfull ignorance of ſuch as would prooue his familie to bee meere ſtraungers: and by his mother, from the
<hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi> kings of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> who ſucceſsiuely were of the houſe of <hi>France,</hi> and by the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of daughters, capable by ſucceſsion to the kingdome of <hi>Nauarre.</hi> And for ſuch hee was eſteemed and accounted, vntil the death of the Duke of <hi>Alencon</hi> the kings bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. VVhen preſently the good olde Cardinall of <hi>Bourbon</hi> was titled in the head, and made beleeue, that in the age of ſixtie yeares hee ſhould liue and ſucceede a king (who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide his yong yeares and ſtrength of bodie, liued not in any ſuch diſordered maner, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee ſhould once haue occaſion to thinke vpon his ſucceſſor) for it was ſhewed him, that hee was the firſt Prince of the blood, and that the right of inheritance and ſucceſsion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in his perſon. But when this deuiſe was found too weake, and the abſurditie too <pb n="306" facs="tcp:22081:155"/>much diſcouered, thereby ſeeking to impugne or deny the king of
<hi>Nauarre</hi> to be the chief and eldeſt branch of his houſe, in the right and title of his father, who in a manner liued in him, (beſides the reuocation by his vncle made vnto him, of all rights, names, voyces, and actions whatſoeuer, both preſent and to come, that might appertaine or belong vnto him, as beeing iſſued from the houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> expreſly acknowledging the ſaid king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> his Nephew, for the true ſonne, heire, ſucceſſor, and repreſentation of the chiefe branch of the ſaid houſe) they inuented other obiections and ſubtile pollicies, that vnder thoſe pretences they might bleare the eyes of the common and ſimple people: affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Crowne of <hi>France</hi> to bee vacant, and ſo belonged to the firſt Conqueror: a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging for reaſon, that as in the populer ſucceſsions of common people, ſuch as are of the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and familie of any houſes, beeing in the tenth degree of conſanguinitie, cannot bee heires of their kinſmans lands, ſo farre in diſcent from them, and therby the inheritance falleth into the Lords hands, and that ſo the houſe of
<hi>Bourbon</hi> had no title or any right to the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> as beeing in the tenth degree of conſanguinitie from it, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they cauſed diuers diſcourſes and whole volumes to bee written.</p>
               <p>But that not beeing able to bee beaten into the heads of true Frenchmen, nor once ſet footing or enter into the opinions of the commun people, altogither incapable of ſuch Sophiſteries, they beganne to enter into an other courſe of iniuries, accuſations, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uections: wherein they contented not themſelues, onely to crie out and make war againſt the ſaid king, and to produce and cauſe to bee publiſhed a perpetuall incapacitie in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and that without the Popes conſent, but they accuſed him of treaſon, they condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, they named him vnwoorthie and incapable to rule in <hi>France:</hi> they aſſembled all the eſtates of
<hi>France</hi> at <hi>Blois,</hi> wherein a manner they vtterly reiected him: euery man ſhewed to bee his enemie, if not in his right and title, yet touching the religion which hee then held, and finally went about to frame his proces. But to the contrarie, thoſe that purſued him, were themſelues executed, before they heard their condemnation or iudgement.</p>
               <p>In this maner the fire beganne to bee kindled in all the foure quarters of the realme, and the blow was of ſuch force, that all neighbour Princes were mooued there at, ſuch as were offended arming themſelues to bee reuenged, and the people in a manner led by a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, helping them, and with them turned their faces againſt the king: whereof the Towne of
<hi>Parris</hi> was the firſt, and by example therof, all the Towns in leſſe then <hi>6.</hi> weeks, made that great &amp; ſtrange co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motion, that continued for the ſpace of fiue whole yeares enſuing. Shee mooued them to this diſſention, by the ſmooth and ſpeciall reaſons by her alleaged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt hereſie, periurie, and tiranny: coniuring them by dutie to their countrie, and by the loue they ought to beare to the preſeruation thereof, to ioyne with her in ſo iuſt a cauſe, and to paſſe one of theſe two waies, (hauing no other meanes) either to bee van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhers, or die in the quarrell, rather then to ſubmit themſelues to the king. And among the reſt, the Cittie of <hi>Lyons,</hi> (neuer inferiour to any Cittie in the world, touching fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie and obedience to their kings, that had no other obiect then onely zeale of religion, in the defence whereof, it eſpied many euident and mortall ſignes) ſuffered it ſelfe to bee borne away among this troupe, not once conſidering or apprehending the multitude of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries by her after that indured.</p>
               <p>And in this manner the warres beganne with ſo ſtraunge an alteration and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all eſtates, yea euen of the very pillers of the land: and the reuolt was ſuch, that in fine, the royaltie of the king was reduced to a ſmall corner of the countrie about <hi>Tours</hi> and
<hi>Blois,</hi> where without doubt the league had buried it, if ſuddainly the king of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre</hi> had not ayded him: who therevpon tooke courage againe, hauing on his ſide the <pb n="309" facs="tcp:22081:155"/>
                  <hi>Hercules</hi> of
<hi>France,</hi> &amp; ſcourge of rebels to their Prince: but when this diſordered and great mutinie beganne ſomewhat to decline, and that the preſence and authoritie of the Soueraigne Prince, held the moſt aſſured within the bounds of their duties, and that <hi>Parris</hi> perceiued it ſelf in way and courſe of extreame deſolation, ſuddainly the king was ſlaine. And then (O the great and deepe iudgements of God) hee that about three moneths before, had paſſed ther riuer of <hi>Loire</hi> onely with foure hundreth horſe, a thouſand ſhot, and certaine pikes, was preſently made chiefe ſoueraigne and commaunder of a moſt faire and great armie, to whom the Magiſtrates and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Crowne, and all the Nobilitie, yeelded their obedience, thereby ſeeking to impeach the deſolation and ouerthrow of the whole eſtate, and to preferre the dutie of naturall fidelitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the vaine hope of ſtraungers, and the laſt hazard of the reſt and ſuretie of their liues and goods. And ſo behold him king, that not ſeuen moneths before had been depriued of the title of the firſt Prince of the blood, and of the hope of the name, Sacrying, and Crowne of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces his aunceſtors, that had ſo many times beene driuen from the Court: that in foure yeares had ſeene tenne armies, and tenne Generals to a king, marching (before the heads of the forces of the greateſt Prince, of the moſt warrelike nation in all the world) againſt him: that after the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of a great forraine power, had withdrawne himſelfe into a corner of the Realme, without land, men, or mony: and a Prince altogither poore, vnleſſe it were in hope. He that had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnable for the Crowne, that had beene made one of the Cardinall of <hi>Bourbons</hi> retinue: that was no more acknowledged to be of the race or progenie of S. <hi>Lewis,</hi> as beeing ten degrees in conſanguinitie from it: he that the countrie of
<hi>Spaine</hi> eſteemed the ſubiect of all our miſeries, who in the life of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ur kings was the only argument of all the tragedies that had been acted in the countrie of
<hi>France:</hi> he that thought not to haue ſucceded a king, being in the flower of his liuely and gallant youth: that had bin an occaſion to the contrarie, if age, and not a moſt cruell and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned knife, had not borne him to S. <hi>Dennis:</hi> he I ſay was king, in the middle of all his troupes, in open field, and by ſound of trumpet proclaimed king of
<hi>France.</hi> And the Catholicque Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, who by reaſon of their diuerſitie of religion, it was thought wold haue ſeparated themſelues from him, were ſo much mooued at the deteſtable murther ſo diſloyally committed againſt the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred perſon of their moſt Chriſtian, Catholicque, and religious king, abhorring that part from whence ſo miſerable a monster had his iſſue, that they choſe rather to preſerue themſelues by kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping togither, then to destroy themſelues by diſvnion: that it remained constant and faithfull to the ſucceſſor of their king, not once diſputing of the lawful vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his Maiestie, &amp; ſo much the rather that he imbraced the preſeruation of the Cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>olicque, Apoſtolicke, and Romaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and promiſed to reciue inſtruction, and make profeſsion thereof. No other meanes reſting, whereby to knit and ioyne that which by diſvnion had been ſeparated, and nothing but the newe opinion of religion, was the cauſe to place a barrier between them, and the meanes that the poore people did not moſt willingly caſt themſelues into his armes. And to the contrarie, the feare of the alteration of religion, putteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of their bounds, &amp; as the waues that breake into a breach, hauing gotten through, do runne with more noyſe and force then before. So he was eſteemed for an hereticke, his goods confiſcate, and his bodie puniſhed, that had not halfe a dozen of maximes or princples readie, thereby with tooth and nayle openly to maintaine, that
<hi>Henry de Bourbon</hi> might not be king, although he were a Catholicke: and that the power of the Pope ſtretched not ſo farre as once to vndertake the hearing of his excuſes, much leſſe to abſolue him. In this general licenciouſneſſe of all things, whereby euery man is permitted both to ſpeake and thinke euil, which filleth <hi>France</hi> with barbariſme and monſters, which maketh the Citties and Townes the gulfes of ciuill furies, wherein it is eaſie to fall, and impoſsible to get out againe: it ſeemed that a whole world, neither yet the raignes of foure kings, would euer haue ended ſo great adeſolation. For thereby is ſeene the deluge of all afflictions fallen vppon the people: confuſion and diſorder ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth and entereth into all places: councels are weake: iuſtice deſpiſed: the foote commanding the head: the treaſurescconſumed: the eſtate becommeth ſicker then ſickeneſſe it ſelfe: and which is more, religion, for the which they take weapon in hand, looſeth more in one moneth, then it get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:22081:156"/>intenne, hauing nothing more contrarie to the increaſing, reſtoring, and beautifying ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then the inſolencie, crueltie, diſobedience, and impietie of ciuil wars. And ſhould wee ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that during theſe monſtrous &amp; mad rebellions, the obedience we owe to God can long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue? VVhat is he that knoweth not how many iniuries religion hath ſuſtained, as well by the defendors, as enemies thereof? both of them eſteeming it a glorie, to violate, blaſpheme, and in a moment to deſtroy the forepaſſed labours of ſo many yeares, and in two houres to ſaw downe the tree that hath growen vp and proſpered for
<hi>1500.</hi> yeares. The people by long draughts ſwallow downe the ſweete breath of libertie, they terme diſorder reaſon, they admitte no lawe, but what they like beſt, and will by no meanes heare ſpeaking of ſuperior. Of the deſpiſing of the Prince, proceedeth diſobedience to God: and from that impietie ſpringeth the diſobedience we ſhew vnto each other. For that long ſufferancealtereth cuſtome, and formeth immitation, and the example of one that eſcapeth vnpuniſhed, mooueth others to commit the like offence. So that among ſo many crimes, diſorders, and confuſions, it is not ſtraunge vnto vs, to ſee our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons haue ſo hard ſucceſſe. For as the horſe that hath newly caſt his Maiſter to the ground &amp; bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his bridle, ceaſeth not to runne till he commeth to ſome place, where with great furie he kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himſelfe: ſo the people abandoning all dutie &amp; reſpect of gouernment, ouerthrow themſelues at the end of their moſt furious courſe: and are like a ſhip in the middle of the wanes, which bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neuer ſo well rigged and furniſhed with warlike ammunition, hauing neither ſaile nor rur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is readie to ſincke, and ſtirreth not but at the pleaſure of a feeble blaſt of wind, which vſeth it as it liſt. To the contrary, the kings armie (that as a rocke reſisteth the proude and raging wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) like agreat riuer paſsing her boundes to ouerflow the medows, aſsiegeth Townes, winneth diuers battels, beareth all before it, and triumpheth in all places. And <hi>Spaine,</hi> which ought either to vnburthen it ſelfe, or at the leaſt be content with the great number of roabes which it daily weareth, and with ſo many Scepters, that impeach it, and reſt it ſelfe: riſeth vp to put vs in feare. She that feareth leaſt our proſperitie would bee her ruine: our peace, her wars: and that our nayles ſhould grow ſo long, therewith to pull that from her, which ſhe and hers hath forcibly taken from vs, ſhe bendeth her cannon ſhot againſt the battered wals of our estate: and ſhe that ſeeing vs tranſported with furie and collor, ought to hide the knife, and quench the fire, putteth it into our hands, therewith to mooue vs to destroy our ſelues. And addeth oyle and wood more to increaſe the fire of our diuiſions, yet all in vaine, for that againſt good Frenchmen, ſhee ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Spaniſh ſhadowes. But after the loſſe of a great battell, and the long and extreame induring of miſeries by the aſsieged townes, euery man beginneth to deteſt wars and to ſeeke peace. And the ordinarie meat wherewith the people were vſually ſerued, beginneth to faile and be diſliked: the goodly and beautifull pretence of religion, that had giuen ſo great an appetite to the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to diſieſt arms, looſeth credite: and it is euidently ſeene, that the war hath more reſpect to the altering of estate, then preſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of religion. And in fine, when at the aſſembly of the league in <hi>Parris,</hi> the D. of <hi>Ferrare</hi> vnder pretence and couer of religion, had propounded the means to ſhake &amp; vtterly ouerthrow the ſalique law, not any good Frenchman but deteſted the deuiſe, as athing more cruel then death it ſelfe. And the Court of Parliament did moſt vertuouſly reſiſt the lamentable ſubuerſion of that law, which hath maintained this monarchie, &amp; continued ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares: and in defence wherof, our forefathers died the plaines of <hi>Poctiers</hi> and <hi>Creſſy,</hi> with their liuely and maſculine blood. And in the mean time, when euery man cried out, and openly ſaid: the king was no king, that they were earneſtly buſied to find an other, that euery man would be, and yet durſt not: his Maieſtie by reuelation of the holy Ghoſt, and for his owne ſaluation, turned to the ſacred and holy boſome of the Church, leauing the error and new opinion, that from his cradle he had alwaies holden, feeling in his ſoule a ſtrong and firme reſolution, to abiure his former impoſtures. He did it not at randon, neither as conſtrained by neceſsitie, by feare of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine vſurpation, for the onely inioying of a temporall peace or Crowne of
<hi>Charles,</hi> but of a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and moſt diuine inſpiration which entered into his ſoule, from the day and time that the death of the K. left the Scepter of <hi>France,</hi> and yeelded it vnto him: from that time he made knowne to our holy father Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fift, by <hi>M. de Luxenbourg,</hi> to Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the <hi>13.</hi> by
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:22081:156"/>the Marqueſſe of <hi>Piſani,</hi> and ſince that, to him who at this day ſitteth in S. <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire, called
<hi>Clement</hi> the eight, by the Cardinall <hi>de Gondy,</hi> that as he was lawful ſucceſſor to the Crowne, he deſired alſo that the ſucceſsion of the Catholicke, Apoſtolicke, and Romane religion, be obſerued in his realme, ſubmitting himſelf to his authoritie and inſtruction touching the ſaluation of his ſoule. And perſeuering in his ſo holy reſolution, he baniſhed from the Court, thoſe that had made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that the world had continued in darkneſſe from the death of the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to the time of <hi>Caluin,</hi> and that the ſplendant ſunne of the truth, had been eclipſed touching the preaching of the Goſpell, and ſhut vp within the territories of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and
<hi>Saxony,</hi> vntil the ſeditious prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings of <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> and
<hi>Martin Luther,</hi> cauſed it to ſhine with greater cleareneſſe: &amp; being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the truth of our religion, by the moſt learned Prelates in all the realme of <hi>France,</hi> he preſented himſelf in the temple of the chiefe Apoſtle of <hi>France,</hi> euen in the middle of the ſhadows of his predeceſſors, &amp; ther, &amp; vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Tombs deteſted his hereſies, the only cauſes of his troubles, &amp; originall of our miſchiefes. There is no reaſon what ſoeuer to be obiected, that can deny this action to be moſt holie, moſt admirable, and moſt miraculous, whether you conſider the happie diſpoſition and aboundance of the yeare, the victorie againſt the Turkes, or the ſuddain conuerſion of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels. For firſt you haue ſeen how God guided this Prince through the middle of ſo many laborinths &amp; dangers of fire and flame, to the throne of royall Maiestie: how this <hi>Ioſeph</hi> perſecuted by his own kindred and familie, triumpheth in <hi>Aegipt:</hi> and how this <hi>Moyſes,</hi> expoſed and abandoned to the mercie of ciuill tempeſtes, becommeth not onely Coronel of an armie of <hi>600000.</hi> men, but king of a great Realme, and of ſo many millions of people. And the king, to giue a taſte and feeling vnto his ſubiects, of the contentment &amp; quietneſſe that his ſoule inioyed by his new co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſion, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to giue euident teſtimonie to all the world, graunteth a truce euen at the verie inſtant when his enemies were readie to yeeld: and ſendeth the Duke <hi>de Neuers</hi> to his holineſſe, ſubmitting himſelf to his commandements, and offering his conſcience (the ſubiect of a goodly conqueſt) giueth him to vnderſtand, thot hee deſireth but one religion in his Realme: that he knoweth well that the Church is one, that faith is not diuided, and that as the bodie can indure but one head, the heauens but one ſun, and religion but one God: ſo the Realme of <hi>France</hi> ought to haue but one Church, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee one, where God is diuerſly ſerued. So if our miſeries are not incenſible vnto him, if it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him not ſpeedily to imbrace the occaſions offered, and mittigate the rigor of formes, not onely our religion, but alſo the eſtate, will bee a pray to long and cruell diuiſions, which continually afflist the countrie of <hi>France.</hi> It is ſaid, hee is one of the moſt woorthieſt ſucceſſors of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> that for the ſpace of one hundreth yeares hath ſit in his chaire, which increaſeth our hopes, and lightneth our mindes, in a maner cleane abated: for that one of the beſt comforts that man can haue in the middle of the waues and ſurges of the ſea, is, when he is aſſured that his Pilot is an expert man, and knoweth what to do. And ſo we hope, that to preſerue this French veſſel from ſhip wracke, he will riſe vp againſt the tempeſt which daily threatneth the ſame: &amp; we know what winds and waues do blow &amp; puſh it forward: and that he will imbrace the conuerſion of ſo importunate a ſoule: for the preſeruation whereof, all <hi>Europe</hi> ought continually to wade in teares, vowes, and prayers. But when the delaies of the Popes Conſistorie were perceiued, togither with the oppoſitions and trauerſes made touching the Ambaſſage of the D. <hi>de Neuers,</hi> when it was well wayed and conſidered, that it were very hard and impoſsible for thoſe in
<hi>Rome</hi> to iudge of that which is done in <hi>France:</hi> that their opinions and wils were forced and conſtrained, and that it was knowne, that in the extreame neceſsitie of taking order for the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth, in ſo vrgent a cauſe they muſt ſtay and attend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon proceſſe, peace beeing broken, and the people longing after the firſt morſels of the truce, they ceaſed not till they were wholly franchiſed from the tirannie of wars, ſpecially the townes that at the beginning were the firſt that tooke weapon in hand, and from thence proceeded the reduction of the Citie of <hi>Lyons</hi> vnder the kings obedience, being not able any longer to continue in her vnconſtant eſtate, nor to ſubiect her ſelfe any more vnder her ruines, fenſes, &amp; diſtrusts, as things moſt doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and miſchiefes moſt vncertaine, ſo that ſhe opened and vncouered her eyes, to know what ſhee ſhould do, and vnder whoſe protection ſhe might beſt be preſerued. Shee knew that the ſoueraigne <pb n="310" facs="tcp:22081:157"/>and laſt remedie of her calamities, was to bee vnder one, and no more to ſlote vncertainly in the waues of diuers protections which haue been cauſes of theſe ciuil warres.</p>
               <p>Shee found that ſhee ought to haue a king of <hi>France,</hi> and in the familie of Saint <hi>Lewis,</hi> from whence deſcendeth <hi>Henry de Bourbon,</hi> king of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Nauarre,</hi> whom ſhe had ſooner acknowledged, if it had pleaſed him ſooner to make profeſsion of the Catholick, Apoſtolicke, and Romaine religion, as at this day he doth.
<hi>Lyons</hi> reſiſted againſt her king, and ramped againſt the gate, and will you haue it ſtill remaine couered in the brakes, that ſhe ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be at the poynt of death, in the middle of the waues of her rebellions? it was at the poynt to become a deſart, and the fable &amp; common marke to be laughed at by al her neighbours, and in the end their conqueſt, alreadie her trafficke (which is her Indes or Perou) her rents, her penſions, &amp; her principall reuenues were cut off and taken away. And no other occupation bare ſway, or was in requeſt with her, but the art of ſouldiers: her Citizens were ſlaine before the gates, and her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall forces began to faile, wherein ſhe ſeeketh for redreſſe, and knowing no better Phiſitian, then hee that loueth his Patient: ſhe caſt her ſelfe into the armes of her king, and drowning the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of her follies paſt, in the ſeas of his great clemencie: ſhe deſired him, from thence forward to accept and receiue her Cittizens, for his true, faithfull, and naturall ſubiects, and not to put any difference between them and others, vnleſſe it were in this poynt, to haue in remembrance that they were the firſt, who without conſtraint acknowledged him for their king, and by their example haue gotten vnto him the beſt part of his flowriſhing Scepter. Behold the iuſt reaſons and cauſes of this ſo ſuddaine change, if the obedience which the ſubiect draweth from the yoake of ſtrangers, to yeeld it vnto his owne ſuperior, may be called a change. And the more commendable it wil be, in ſo much as that the ſeruice of the king is not contrarie to the commandement of God: that religion remaineth firme within her franchiſes, ſhining in her glorie, &amp; inuiolable &amp; vnexpugnable in her forces. As long as the wars were wholly for religion, they contributed whatſoeuer they had, but when they once perceiued that the holy conuerſion of the king made this war, no more war againſt religion, but onely againſt the eſtate, they could not longer delay, nor withdraw out of their mindes, the feare and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence they owe to the true image of God, which is the king, beleeuing certainly that thoſe beare armes and fight againſt God, that rebel againſt a moſt Catholicke and Chriſtian Prince. In this ſo great diſorder, great wiſedome &amp; good order hath bin ſeene, for that the moſt aduiſed and beſt experienced, concerning matters of eſtate, iudged this quotidian feuer, could by no meanes bee healed, but by ſome ſtrong and violent remedie. But by the prouidence of God, the diſeaſe that in mans iudgement ſeemed incurable, hath been healed without ſhedding one drop of blood, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and firm reſolution of thoſe that rather deſire to die, then not to ſee themſelues franchiſed from this gouernment, which is contrarie to the royall eſtate, and loſed from the middle of ſo many protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which how holy or iuſt ſoeuer they be, are altogither dangerous, and the beſt title they can bear is of no value. To be ſhort, this towne which hath alwaies made ſhew of pure religion towards God, and fidelitie to her Prince, hath well ſhewed that the flower de luce, which for the ſpace of ſo many hundreth yeares had been grauen in her heart, could not be pulled away but by cleauing and renting in peeces the hearts of all her Cittizens: that ſhe could not brooke nor once indure, ſuch Frenchmen as are tranſubſtantiated into Spaniſh minds, that gape onely to ſee this Scepter broken, this crowne in peeces, that they might gather the remnants, and plucke off the flowers.

Their writings are of blacke and thicke cloudes, which neuer appeare without ſome thunder of euill reports, iniuries, and ſlaunders: Tables repreſenting nothing but infamous pictures of Monſters, and Arches of imperfections. And when they enter into the deepe conſideration of the Authors of our euilles, they throwe the fault and miſchiefes of theſe deuiſions, ſometimes vppon one, and ſome times vppon an other, their opinions beeing furred onely with the drugges of hated, or of zeale which tranſporteth their mindes.

<hi>Monluc</hi> &amp; <hi>Marillac,</hi> were of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the moſt aſſured means to ſtop thoſe new ſprung ſects, was to ſubmit themſelues to a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell: and in fine, the concluſion of this aſſembly was, that a Parliament of the generall States ſhould be holden at <hi>Meaux,</hi> in the moneth of December after: and a nationall Councell the tenth of Ianuary then next after enſuing.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament was holden at <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the king ſent for the king of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre</hi> to come thither, and to bring the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> his brother with him, that there hee might cleare himſelfe of the hard report that ranne againſt him: to the which end, they ſet forward, and arriued at <hi>Orleans,</hi> preſenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto the king, that intertained them not as their qualities and neareneſſe of blood required. For the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was committed priſoner, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance was ſued by the Ladie <hi>Renee,</hi> duches of
<hi>Ferrare,</hi> neuertheleſſe his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe was framed: wherevnto hee pleaded not guiltie: yet in fine, hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to haue his head ſtriken off before the kings Pallace, and at the entrie of the States: vpon the which iudgement, he continually expected the houre of death. But by Gods prouidence, the death of the king procured both his life and libertie: for king
<hi>Charles</hi> iudged him to be innocent. At the ſame time, the Court of Parliament in <hi>Parris</hi> made an Edict, the Parliament of Eſtate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, and the difference of religion was appeaſed, by ſtaying for a generall Councell. Meanetime, <hi>Meſsieurs de Guiſe,</hi> being in hope that their greatneſſe would ſtill increaſe and ſpread abroad, were much abaſhed to ſee it ſhortened by the death of the king their Nephewe: and thereby to be conſtrained and put in minde, to thinke that they were no more as they had been. So that they yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their place to the King of
<hi>Nauarre,</hi> but not the opinion, nor the hope to recouer it once againe. By that means their great affaires left off, but they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke them not, ſeeking by all meanes to be reconciled to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> alwaies keeping their owne, (like the Maiſter of a ſhippe that hoyſeth and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth downe his ſayles as time ſerueth) and alwaies ſtopped the holes wherein they foreſawe the round world enter: ceaſing not to ſpeake moſt aſſuredly and openly againſt hereſie, which they ſo much the more deteſted, as that they perceiued the Princes of the blood, to lend their helping hand towards the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement and eſtabliſhing thereof: and that the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> that made account thereof, began to like it, hauing more deſire to the Realm of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> that was promiſed to be reſtored vnto him, and to that of <hi>Sardaigne</hi> offered him, if he would ſeparate himſelfe from the Princes reformed, and the protection of the proteſtants Churches, then to the conſideration of the quarrell of his houſe. The greatneſſe of thoſe Princes could not continue equall, by reaſon of the vnequallitie of their houſes. Yet they ſought to go all in one ranke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the kings fauor could no ſooner giue countenance to the one, but it moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the other. His fauour is like a faire Ladie, euery man ſeeketh and courteth her, and if ſhe ſmile more vpon one then vppon the other, it breedeth but iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, deſpight, &amp; quarrell: &amp; ſhe cannot diuide her heart in two, without a a mortall diuiſion. Euery man hath his turne, and both Catholicque and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenot, vnder pretence and zeale of religion, ſeeketh to get the good wil of the king, his mother, and his bretheren. But the freedome of the Miniſters, being impatient to ſtaye the reſolution of a Councell, made them to preach openly, whereby they ſo much tempted and altered mens conſciences, that ſuddainly the ceremonies &amp; traditions of the Church, were abated, and the temples ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vpon &amp; deſtroyed.

That peace was the readie remedie to bring his ſubiects to one religion: to eſtabliſh iuſtice: to correct abuſes: reforme manners: comfort the Cleargie and the people: reuiue the qualities and horrors of his Nobilitie, in a manner imbaſed by thoſe diuiſions. That the peace being well holden and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, it would procure an entire and ful contentment to al eſtates: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by iuſtice would bee in force by authoritie of the lawes.

That he neuer fauoured the ſucceſsion of a king, that ſhould be to the diſaduantage of the Catholicque religion: that it was in a manner to conſtraine nature &amp; time, ſo much to diſtruſt the goodneſſe of God, as to vndertake a quarrell touching the ſucceſsion of the Crowne, during his life, beeing healthfull and ſtrong of bodie, his Queen the flower of her age,<note place="margin">This is ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Guiſe, that was Great-maiſter of France.</note> &amp; euery man in hope that God would ſend them iſſue: that the Princes which complained to bee out of his fauour, had receiued as great fauour and rather more, then euer they deſerued, hauing honoured them with the greateſt and moſt honourable offices of his Crowne, which in times paſt were not giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but to the Princes of the blood. And in fine, hauing promiſed to reſtore the Church to her ſplendure, the Nobilitie to their contentment, iuſtice to her authoritie, and comfort to the people, hee prayed, coniured, exhorted, and commaunded, all Eccleſiaſticall perſons, Gentlemen, Parliaments, and Townes, to ſeparate themſelues from all ſuch meanes, as might impeach the effect of ſo holy an intent: and to leaue all leagues and aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiations, vniting themſelues vnder his obedience, as by nature, dutie, and their owne welfare they were bound.

                     <p>Wherein hee fully diſcouered his religion and manner of faith, ſhewing that hee had been borne during the Schiſme and permiſsion of two religions in <hi>France,</hi> that he neither could nor would leaue that, wherin he had bin brought vp and inſtructed, if by a lawfull Councell hee were not otherwiſe conuerted: and that ſtill then they could not hold him for an hereticque, much leſſe as one that had falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the church: affirming that he had neuer bin hereticque, nor <pb n="26" facs="tcp:22081:170"/>contrary to his firſt opinion: and that they thought rather to deſtroy, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him: and to ouerthrow, then vnite him.

And that aſſoone as his Maieſtie by his Edicts, had conſented to the libertie of mens conſciences, he preſently left armes, and countermanded his troupes, togither with the forrain aydes of his friends and confederates. That for that cauſe, hee is not enemie to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licques as the report goeth. That hee maintaineth thoſe of <hi>Bearn,</hi> in the ſmall libertie they had when the Queen his mother died, and ſo in all places of the kingdome of <hi>Nauarre</hi> then reſting vnto him, where hee found the exerciſe of Catholicque religion, he neuer permitted any change.

Hee thought that the ramparts &amp; defences of his Eſtate, were alreadie abated: hee beleeued that alreadie, the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> held him by the collor: it ſeemed
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:22081:170"/>vnto him, that his Pallace of <hi>Louure</hi> was beſieged, with great paine they could hardly make him come foorth of the Capucins ſell: it was no more he that wan the battelles of <hi>Iarnac</hi> and <hi>Moncontour,</hi> generoſitie wanted, and his heart began to faile.

If the king had ſhewed himſelf to the league, not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with a Penitents garment, or habit of an Hermit: not by faire and plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meanes, but with conſtancie, courage, and reſolution woorthie a Maieſtie royall, hee had well made them knowe him to bee king, the true and onely Image of God, that had thunder readie in his hand to conſume and confound ſuch as roſe vp againſt him: the warre would bee ended. The armie of the Duke <hi>de Guiſe,</hi> which at his firſt riſing and in the flower thereof, was but a thouſand horſe, and foure thouſand foote, had been diſpearſed in leſſe then a month: and the Cardinall <hi>de Bourbon</hi> had confeſſed to the Queene-mother, that if the king had banded his authorithie againſt him, all his attempts had been cleane ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. Feare is a plague to valiant mindes, but when the heart of the chiefe commander is poſſeſt therewith, his authoritie is abated, it dimiſheth, falleth, and vndermineth it ſelfe: for feare in flameth the courage, and cauſeth men ſo much more boldly to enterpriſe their wicked actions, as that they are aſſured they ſhal not be puniſhed. Alſo the king letting ſlip this reuolt, rather ſpeaking faire, then commaunding: and yeelding, rather then oppoſing: thereby drew all the miſchief of thoſe toubles vppon his owne head. He deſired the Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother to beare ſome of his blowes,<note place="margin">This is the opinion of the Author that made the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. fol. <hi>22.</hi> The laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Princes of the league.

This Prince of great hope, wiſe, and valerous, and one of the greateſt Captains that
<hi>France</hi> in long time had bred, perceiuing that ſo hardy an enterpriſe had alreadie taken ſo good effect, and made ſo great a change, purſued it, and perceiuing the king to yeeld vnto him, hoped more then he either thought or ought to do. And there vppon preſented the king with another requeſt, wherein very wiſely hee motioned his owne intereſt, togither with the common cauſe, ſigned by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and the Cardinall of
<hi>Bourbon,</hi> tending to this end. To deſire him to make and ſweare an vnreuocable edict for the extirpation of hereſies. To take by force the Townes holden by thoſe of the new religion. To reuowne the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of

                     <p>Therevppon with all ſpeede the peace was made, and caſt into a mould, the king ſuffering himſelfe by that feare to bee ſo much carried away. And by the edict, hee prohibited the exerciſe of the new religion, reuoked all other edicts that fauoured it: commaunded the Miniſters out of the land: and all his ſubiects within ſixe months after, to make profeſsion of the Catholicque re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or to depart out of the Realme: diſpearſed the tripartite chambers of Parliaments: ordained that the Towns giuen in hoſtage to thoſe of the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhould bee yeelded vppe: and not onely commended, but approoued the warre by the Princes begunne, acknowledging it to bee done for his ſeruice.</p>

                  <p>The Duke <hi>Ioyeuſe</hi> was at his backe, and all the Peſants held watch, readie to riſe at the firſt call: and the Princes troupes were ſo wearied, as they could not poſsible bee more. The meanes whereby he thought to paſſe the <hi>Loire,</hi> in two or three places betweene <hi>Blois</hi> and <hi>Amborſe</hi> beeing cut off, his feare increaſed, and his troupes being but ſmall beganne to diminiſh. And yet there happened two difficulties more in his campe: the one, that ſuch as had friends in <hi>Beauſſe, Perche, Vendoſme,</hi> and <hi>Maine,</hi> ſtale away from him, in ſuch maner, that in ſome of his Cornets hee had not twentie ſtrong: the other was, that the <hi>Sieur de Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han,</hi> and diuers Lords of his troupes, beeing of aduiſe not to paſſe any further forward, &amp; that if they did, it would be a means to run head long into euident danger, tooke leaue of him, &amp; turned towards <hi>Brittaigne,</hi> where they eſcaped many dangers: neuertheleſſe, in time they paſſed couragiouſly ouer <hi>Loire,</hi> and entered ſafely into <hi>Rochel.</hi> This ſeparation was the cauſe that the Prince had no more but his own Cornet, the company of the <hi>Sieurs de la Trimouille,</hi> &amp;

For they were of aduiſe to ſeparate themſelues into ſmall troupes, of twelue or fifteene in a companie, the eaſilier to ſaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, for it was not poſsible for them beeing all togither, to indure aboue an houre, perceiuing their enemies to make towardes them ſo faſt: therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing left their carriage, diſcharged their booties, and for the moſt part became better Chriſtians, then they were at their departure from the ſiege of <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,</hi> they ſaued themſelues, and although the Townes of <hi>Orleans, Blois, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe,</hi> and <hi>Tours,</hi> were ſtraightly guarded: neuertheleſſe, diuers of them being armed, paſſed the bridges of the ſame Townes, each man ſauing himſelfe as well as hee could.</p>

                  <p>As for <hi>Tiercelin,</hi> although he knew that his enemies watched his returne, hee made no account thereof, truſting in the ſtrength of his Regiment, and ſo reſolued to fight with them whereſoeuer they ſhould aſſayle him: and vppon the ſeuenteenth of Aprill, he marched towards <hi>Sainctes</hi> in very good order.

In that firſt charge, the <hi>Sieur de Trimouille</hi> had his horſe flain betweene his legges, and without ſpeedie ſuccour had, been in great daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Tiercelin</hi> beeing hurt in the arme, ſaued himſelfe, with a great number of hurt men.

                  <p>But as there are many, who not withſtanding they haue contrary windes, yet doo arriue in ſafetie at their deſired port: ſo diuers men receiue ſo many croſſes in their enterpriſes, that fortune neuer fauoureth neither their valour, nor their vertues. In times paſt, hee had done many valiant acts in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> and now hee imployed time, mony, and great labour, to do no great matter in <hi>Guyen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His armie was of fiue hundreth French horſemen, eight hundreth Rutters, foure hundreth Lanciers Albanois, and about fiue thouſand foote, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers peeces of artillery.

                  <p>At his arriuall, <hi>Xaintonge</hi> and <hi>Poitou</hi> trembled, being as then afflicted with three poynts of Gods horrible puniſhments, plague, famine, &amp; war: where the ſouldiers found no other booties, but famiſhed rattes. Hee imployed them firſt in the taking of

                  <p>But their want was ſo great in the armie, and the extremitie ſo much, that it fluttered but with one whing.</p>

The ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of wordes, was ſomewhat aſſwaged at the third meeting, wherein the Queene-mother ſtrained the corde, that brake both the accord and harmonie of their conference: for ſhe tolde him, that the laſt and onely reſolution of the king, was, neuer to make peace, nor take truce with him, if hee became not a Catholicque.

That the neceſsitie of their bellie would cauſe the head to rebell. That fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine would cauſe diſſeaſes among them, and leſſen their troupes. From this Councell proceeded two great effects, but different in execution: hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the Duke <hi>Ioyeuſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The battel of Coutras.</note> to keepe the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> in <hi>Poitou,</hi> and rather to hazard battell, then ſuffer him to paſſe the riuer of
<hi>Loire,</hi> as hee determined to do at the head thereof: aſſuring him, that the ruine of the forraine armie depended there vppon: to the which end, the Duke <hi>de Ioyeuſe</hi> that had anarmie fortified both with men, munition, artillerie, and meanes, marched towards <hi>Coutras,</hi> to paſſe <hi>la Drongne</hi> at <hi>Gue:</hi> and vpon Tueſday the twentieth of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſtayed with all his forces, between <hi>la Roche, Chalais,</hi> and <hi>Coutras,</hi> the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> made towards him, fully reſolued to fight. And his troupes, not mercinarie but choſen ſouldiers, not conſtrained but free, that deſired rather <pb n="39" facs="tcp:22081:183"/>to ſweate in a skirmiſh, then heate themſelues in a Tennis-court: rather to purſue a flying enemie, then ſtaye to drinke ſweet and pleaſant malueſie at a bankette, that feared nothing but the loſſe of their reputation, ſtayed onely but till they had the word to giue the onſet. And after they had bin long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to fight, and greeued with outrages and threatnings, they ſell to blowes. And about eight of the clocke in the morning, the king of <hi>Nauarres</hi> artillery began to play, and that of the Duke <hi>de Ioyeuſe</hi> to aunſwere them, but not very luckely, for that eyther the ignorance or the mallice of the Canno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier had placed it ſo low, that the mouth of the cannon ſhot right vpon a litle hill of earth, wherein the bullet ſtayed without pearcing further.</p>
                  <p>The battell was ſo ſoone deſcided, that in tenne houres this great armie of the king (that had the aduantage, both for place and number, beganne to retire) was ſooner broken then fought withall. The king of
<hi>Nauarre,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the Earle of
<hi>Sotſſons,</hi> behaued themſelues moſt valiantly, executing the offices both of Captaines and ſouldiers, and gaue thankes to God in open field, all died with blood, and hilled and couered with dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: and among the reſt, with the bodies of Duke <hi>de Ioyeuſe, Monſieur de</hi> Saint
<hi>Sauueur</hi> his brother, and fiue and twentieth other Gentlemen of name. All their Cornets were taken, with the artillerie and baggage, and foureteene Gentlemen of account taken and put to raunſome. That done, the king of
<hi>Nauarre</hi> beeing eaſed of ſo many nettes that were ſet vp to catch him, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched forward to ioyne with the forraine armie, and to paſſe the riuer of <hi>Loire:</hi> but the king lay incamped at a little Village called
<hi>Lere,</hi> between <hi>Coſne</hi> and <hi>Neuſuy,</hi> impeached him by the aduiſe of <hi>Monſieur de Neuers,</hi> cauſing the guets betweene
<hi>Pouilly</hi> and <hi>Dony</hi> to bee broken downe, filling them with thouſands of trees, ſtones, and chaines, to entangle the feete of the Rutters horſes that ſhould paſſe. And intrueth, the letting of that paſſage, next to the helpe of God, was the ſecond cauſe of the aduantage the king had of the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie. For the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> that followed the armie, durſt not ſet vpon it, nor hinder it from ſpoyling villages, therewith to refreſh it ſelfe. But aſſoone as it perceiued it ſelfe to be in that incloſure, and that they muſt of force recule, to take the left hand, and enter into a countrie wherein the Rutter had neuer hunted the Hart, and conſidring the ſcituation, it beganne to be abaſhed and fall into a mutenie, and looſe courage: and hauing failed of their enterpriſe at <hi>la Charite,</hi> it entered into the way of
<hi>Beauce,</hi> drawing towards <hi>Montargis,</hi> and ſo ſtayed at
<hi>Vimori,</hi> or thereabouts. Where the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, determined to diſlodge them, and tooke them ſo ſuddainly, about ſeuen of the clocke in the euening, that they ſooner heard the cries of the dying &amp; hurt men, then the <hi>Qui va la</hi> of the Sentinels.<note place="margin">The <hi>27.</hi> of Octobr.</note> The Rutters were readier to place themſelues in order of battell, then to ſaue their baggages, or impeach the ſpoyle made by the ſouldiers. There the Barron of

                  <p>Some of the buſieſt, which after that time were named the ſixteen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to vtter their deuiſes, and ſecretly to vent their falſe monies, filling the hearts and eares of the common people with feares, by conſideration of the vnrecouerable fall of the Church: of ſecret fauours and intelligences with the King of <hi>Nauarre:</hi> of deſpiſing the Catholicque Princes: of aduancement of <hi>Migrons:</hi>

<hi>Parris.</hi> And if you would knowe what parts were in him, to vndertake ſo hautie an enterpriſe, hearken what a great perſonage of our time writeth thereof.

Hee is indued with much vertue, certain effects take good ſucceſſe, and with the name and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of his father: by ciuill warre, he preſently became the chiefe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunder of the Catholicque faction, ſpecially ſeeking to get the fauour of thoſe townes, that feared a Prince of the religion, whom he flattered by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny priuate meanes, chiefe and cettaine ſignes of a minde aſpiring vnto tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.

Hitherto my ſoueraigne Courts of Parliament neuer counſelled mee vnto it, for the preiudice I might induce into, the liberties of my Crowne, and fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes of the Cleargie of this Realme: and fortaine Princes haue not receiued it, but as farre as it was conformable to their willes, and haue taken out of it the thornes that pricked them. That I ſhould eſtabliſh the Inquiſition at the leaſt in all my Townes: this word breedeth a feare in euery man. The Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition was not inuented but againſt Infidelles, for that after my aunceſtors had reduced

<hi>Arragon,</hi> perceiuing that by the patching of ſo many ſuperſtitions, both of the Sinagogue, and the Alcaron of Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion beganne to be corrupted, he determined to conſtraine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, or to leaue the country, ſuch as to ſtay &amp; that made more account of their liuings then their conſciences, purged not themſelues ſo well of their errors, but that there reſted ſome dregges of their firſt opinions, which they held by ſucceſsion from their aunceſtors, and deſired rather like the Duke of <hi>Friez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to go to hell with their ſects, then to Paradice without them. For men do hardly forgo the religion by them learned from their cradles, &amp; the more they are afflicted to make them leaue it, ſo much the more they harden their mindes againſt torments: the more the exerciſe is forbidden them, the more they ſeeke it: and the more they are mooued, the more they ſtirre: they began to informe againſt them, whereof the <hi>Iacobins</hi> as then newly produced into the Church by Saint
<hi>Domenicke</hi> (ful of doctrine and religion) had the charge, who imployed prayers and exhortations, and would not vſe violent purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, thereby not to ſtirre vppe an aboundance of humours, that might ſtop
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:22081:187"/>the heart or the liuer, this peaceableneſſe and toleration being daungerous in the Church, they beganne to vſe rigor againſt thoſe miſerable Marians, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Inquiſition: and ſince that, it hath been exerciſed againſt ſuch as are not ſound in Catholicque religion.</p>
                  <p>The formes ſince that time added therevnto are very ſtraunge, as the length of proceeding to aunſweres, the voluntary confeſsions of thoſe that are accuſed: the ſlaunders and boldneſſe of their officers called Flyes: the priſon vnder ground, ſoule, obſcure, and fearefull: the puniſhment with trochelles and wheeles, the ſinewes, the water, and the fron, the yealow Caſocke without ſleeues painted full of diuels, which they call <hi>Saubenite,</hi> the myter, gagge, and the cord, and that which is the laſt part of this pittifull tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedie, the fire haue made this inquiſition (which I thinke neceſſary in <hi>Spaine</hi>) ſo ſtrange vnto the Flemmings, and ſo deteſtable to the Frenchmen, that the Frenchmen will rather a thouſand times indure that which the Flemmings haue ſuffered, then ſubiect themſelues vnto it, to eſtabliſh this inquiſition, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the light toyes of the Frenchmen, the liberties we poſſeſſe within theſe thirtie yeares, and the curioſities that are naturally in vs, there would not be wood ynough to burne my ſubiects.</p>
                  <p>I will not doo it, I had rather haue a ſicke then a dead bodie, I will not make religion a Butcherie, or the alter of a ſacrifice which is not bloodie, a pillorie or place of execution: no, the king of

It belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vnto God to accord theſe falſe notes, that are heard in the harmonie of his Church.</p>
                  <p>They would likewiſe that I ſhould conſent vnto the Cleargie, that they may purchaſe in fee farme ſuch goods as heeretofore haue beene alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from their Churches, and conſtraine the poſſeſſors thereof to ſell them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: that is as much to ſay, that I ſhould fight for the Church, &amp; the Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie ſhall keepe their temporall goods, while the people playe the Alkamiſts with their teeth. They will giue the alarme, and neuer come to battell. All the reſt of their articles touching the ſale of Huguenots goods, and of their diſabling, are alreadie ordained, men are imployed therein, all my parliaments are troubled therewith. What do they demaund of me, which I haue not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed vnto not beeing able to refuſe it? and how many things haue I graun-vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which I could refuſe, becauſe I ought not ſo to do it? There is no ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newe in his polliticke bodie, but it is wreſted, nor any member which doth not languiſh. They haue conſtrained mee to playe and hazard my eſtate by chaunce of warres: I haue alreadie loſt the halfe, let them ſuffer me to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe my ſelfe into the other halfe and liue in peace.</p>
                  <p>Such were the obiections of this Prince, at the motions of the leaguers articles, but becauſe of nature hee was fearefull, feeble, and light, hee neuer had firme reſolution within his minde. Princes moſt commonly do faile by not beleeuing counſell, but hee deceiued himſelfe by too much credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
                  <p>The firſt poynt of this miſchiefe was, that trueth was kept from him, and that men followed his humors.</p>
                  <p>Hee was perſwaded the ſtrongeſt part to bee that of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> that all <pb n="62" facs="tcp:22081:188"/>the Townes and Prouinces had their mindes ſet on him, that if hee entered not into it, he would bee left alone, at the mercie both of the League and the Huguenot.</p>
                  <p>Yet he firmly reſolued to bee Maiſter, and to range both the one and the other vnder his obedience: but it was by a weake meanes, imbracing the Duke of <hi>Guiſes</hi> part, and made himſelfe principall of the one ſide, with all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie to make warre againſt the Herereticque, ſpeaking of nothing but of a voyage into <hi>Poitou,</hi> to beſiege
<hi>Rochel,</hi> and to take the Iſle of <hi>Rhie.</hi> And that which moſt fauoured this enterpriſe, was, that the Huguenots had loſt the Prince of
<hi>Conde,</hi> vnder whoſe valour and generoſitie, they conceiued great hopes, and without doubt, as being indowed with all the quallities conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for a valiant Captaine, and otherwiſe an vnrecouerable enemie of their enemies. His diſeaſe was violent, procured by a noſegaye giuen him by ſome of his houſholde ſeruants, for that vppon Thurſday beeing the third day of March, halfe an houre after he had ſupt, a great paine in the ſtomacke, ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of breath, hardneſſe of the bellie, and continuall vometing, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame paine and thirſt, tooke him.</p>
                  <p>And the Saterday after, when his Phiſitians and Surgeons had imployed all Art, experience, and fidelitie to heale him, growing ſicker, a generall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foration of all the powers of his bodie ceaſed vppon him, whereof within an houre after hee died. His bodie was opened, wherein they found all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of his bellie blacke, and burnt, the guttes full of reddiſh water, the ſtomacke aboue the orifice,<note place="margin">The death of the Prince of Conde, ſater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the <hi>5.</hi> of March.</note> pearced cleane through and round about, and the vitall powers (that of themſelues were very helpeful and well compoſed) by reaſon of the great quantitie of poyſon were all vlcered.</p>
                  <p>The king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> at his returne out of
<hi>Gaſcongne,</hi> commanded expreſly, that all thoſe that were ſuſpected to bee neceſſarie to the poyſoning of the Prince, ſhould bee puniſhed, for the which ſome were executed. Meane time, the King that had the enterpriſe of the League rather then that of the Huguenots, more imprinted in his minde, knowing that all their demaunds tended onely to this end, to make a perpetuall warre, prepared himſelfe to preuent it, and cauſed certaine forces to bee aſſembled vnder the conduct of the Duke
<hi>d'Eſpernon,</hi> againſt whome all the league diſcharged their chollor, making him the onely argument of the confuſion and diſorder of all his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, their iealouſie more increaſing by the ſucceſsion of the place of the Admirall, and of the gouernment of <hi>Normandie,</hi> which hee had newly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued after the death of the Duke <hi>de Ioyeuſe.</hi> This poynt deſerueth to paſſe two ſteps out of my matter, the Admirall in

At al times the moſt warlike countrie of <hi>France,</hi> (both by ſea &amp; land) hath had her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralles, and the Frenchmen of <hi>Brittaine, Narbonne,</hi> and

<hi>Guiſe</hi> deſired him, to aduertiſe the Queen his Miſtreſſe thereof, to the end it might bee known. The Ambaſſadour aunſwered, that he beleeued the Duke had willed him to ſay ſo, that the higheſt and hardieſt enterpriſes often times lye hidden and ſecret in the minds of thoſe that vndertake them, and that (when they thinke good) they make them knowne with ſuch colour and ſhewe, as they thinke beſt for their purpoſe, that he could not chuſe but tell him plainely, that that which paſſed in <hi>Parris,</hi> would bee found very ſtraunge, and euill thought of by all chriſtian Princes hauing intereſt therein.</p>
                  <p>That no cloake or couer, how faire ſoeuer it might bee, could cauſe it to bee liked of, it beeing the dutie of a ſubiect to continue in the iuſt obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his Prince.

                           <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ir, I am very vnfortunate, that thoſe who of long time, by many deuiſes haue ſought to ſeparate mee from your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and great fauour, haue had ſufficient meanes wholly to fruſtrate all my good indeuours, vſed to win your liking, and by my ſeruices make my ſelf agreeable to your Maieſtie: which not long ſince, I haue well prooued, to my no little greefe.</p>
                        <p>For that being wearie of ſo many falſe reports vſed, thereby to make your Maieſtie continually to diſtruſt mee, I determined with the hazard, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I was threatned, to iuſtifie my life, hauing reſolued to come vnto you with ſo ſmall a troupe, and with free truſt and confidence, as I hoped by that meanes to let all the world ſee, that I was farre from that, whereof my euill willers ſought by ſo many deuiſes to yeeld mee culpable. But the enemies of publike quietneſſe, not beeing able to indure my admiſsion to your preſence, eſteeming that in ſhort time it would ſoone diſcouer the impoſtures vſed to make mee odious, and by little and little giue me place in your good fauour, rather wiſhed by their pernicious counſels, to bring al things into confuſion, &amp; your eſtate and town of <hi>Parris</hi> in hazard, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to indure me near vnto your perſon. Their euill wils is manifeſtly knowne in the reſolution, (that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Queen your mothers knowledge, &amp; againſt the aduiſe of your wiſeſt Councellors) they cauſedyour Maieſtie to take by an vnaccuſtomed means, and in a time full of ſuſpition and partiallities, to place forces in your Towne of <hi>Parris,</hi> to keepe the publicque places thereof, and the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeech giuen foorth, that they hoped being Maiſters thereof, they ſhould bring you to many other things, whollycontrary to your good nature, and ſuch as at this time I had rather keepe ſilent, then once to vtter. The feare therof, conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned your good and loyall ſubiects to arme themſelues, by reaſon of the iuſt fear they had that by ſuch means the thing was inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to be executed, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with long before they had bin threatned. God by his grace hath holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> things in better ſtaye then wee could wiſh, and hath as it were miraculouſly preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued your Towne from a moſt perilous hazard. And the beginning, purſute, and effect of thoſe affaires hath in ſuch manner iuſtified my intents, that I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme your Maieſtie and all the world, doth thereby cleerely perceiue how farre my actions are ſeparated from ſlanders, the pretences wherof my ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous enemies would accuſe me.</p>
                        <pb n="86" facs="tcp:22081:199"/>
                        <p>The manet how is thus: Firſt, I came voluntary vnto your Maieſtie, and put my ſelfe into your power, I ſhewed the confidence and truſt I had in your good nature, and the ſinceritie of my ſeruice. The eſtate wherin I was found when I receiued the firſt newes of that enterpriſe, which diuers of your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants can witneſſe, ſheweth that I doubted not any iniurie, nor haue any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of enterpriſe, being with leſſe company, more diſarmed, and in my houſe, then one of my quallitie either may or ought to bee.</p>
                        <p>The reſpect then that I haue vſed, containing my ſelfe within the ſimple bounds of a iuſt defence, are witneſſes ſufficient vnto you, that no occaſion can make mee fall from the dutie of a moſt humble ſubiect. The paine I take to reſtraine the people, and hinder them that they might not proceed to the effects, which oftentimes ſuch accidents do breed, diſchargeth me from the ſlaunders heretofore impoſed vpon me, that I would trouble your towne of <hi>Parris:</hi> the care I ſhould haue taken to preſerue them, whom I knewe by the craftie meanes of my enemies, had giuen me bad report vnto your Maieſtie, maketh it euident vnto all men, that I neuer intended to attempt any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your ſeruants and officers, as I am falſely accuſed. The manner of my behauior to your Switzers, and the Captains and ſouldiers of your guard, are ſufficient aſſurance that I feared nothing more, then to diſpleaſe you: if your Maieſtie knew all the particularities, as I think the greateſt part of your good ſeruitors louing publike peace, that are witneſſes, haue not hidden them from you: I am perſwaded it remaineth cleared by that means. That I neuer had the leaſt of the miſcheeuous intents, for the which my enemies by falſe reports would make me odious.</p>
                        <p>I hope the end will yet giue more aſſured teſtimonie, hauing receiued one of the greateſt diſpleaſures that could happen vnto mee, when I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood your Maieſtie had determined to depart, becauſe your ſuddain depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bereaued mee of the meanes, as I pretended, to pacifie and effect all things to your liking, and ſawe them well diſpoſed therevnto, at ſuch time as the Queene your mother, vouchſafed me the honour to come vnto mee: whereof I gaue her ſo good liking, that I thinke ſhe might be aſſured there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And although I could not as then ſhew it, I will not ceaſe to continue the ſame good will, and doubt not but to behaue my ſelfe in ſuch ſort, that your Maieſtie ſhall thinke me a moſt faithfull ſubiect and ſeruant, and one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth nothing ſo much, then that in doing ſeruice, and purchaſing the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of your Realme, I may obtaine the good fortune of your fauour, which I will neuer ceaſe to purchaſe, vntill it pleaſeth God to graunt meethe meanes: whom I beſeech to giue your Maieſtie, &amp;c. from <hi>Parris</hi> this 17. of May,

As touching new matter of impeachment, the ſaid <hi>Eſpernon</hi> ſought to make ſome controuerfie in <hi>Normandie,</hi> which hee had found hard ynough, if for the deſire we had, to ſee wars begun againſt the hereticques, wee had not dealt in his affaires, and procured our friends to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and not once to trouble or moleſt him, but the more to entangle vs, both by thoſe ſuperfluous Garriſons, and loſt voyage, wholly to breake the courſe of warre, and to turne it againſt vs, they deuiſed a means to impeach our honour, cauſing certaine leuies to be raiſed, thereby to cauſe vs to bee more feared then the hereticques, which are, that wee deſire a maſſacre in <hi>Parris,</hi> that we would take the king, and ſacke the towne, thereby to procure mony, wherewith to make warres againſt whom wee thinke good: with other ſuch like things put into his Maieſties head, with the greateſt ſhewes of ſinceritie in his behalfe that may be deuiſed, therby to procure them more credite, which hath been the deuiſe that hath moſt put vs in diſpaire, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by perceiuing the king more bent to prouide for his owne defence, then to continue warres againſt the hereticques: and that we are ſo vnfortunate, as to be ſo hardly eſteemed of by ſome, and ſo farre, that his holyneſſe himſelfe hath by his letter ſeemed to perſwade vs vnto fidelitie to the king our Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne. This diſpaire laſtly procured (I ſay) did ceaſe ſo much the more vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon me, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as I vnderſtood that the king would ſtrengthen his guard with ſource companies of French men, and three of Switzers, in ſuch manner, that not deſiring to ſtay longer in ſuſpition of ſo vile actions, within 12. houres after, I arriued in <hi>Parris,</hi> accompanied with 8. Gentlemen, and in the middle of al the guards aforeſaid, I went to kiſſe the kings hands, hauing no other ſafe conduct but my ſeruices, and the confidence that a good ſubiect ought to put in his king. This free acceſſe, ſinceritie, &amp; open heart, me thinketh ought to be a cleare iuſtification of me touching al falſe reports. And in truth, there was no horeſt man but reioyced in his heart, as euery man well perceiued. The next day, beeing alwaies aſſured in my conſcience, I ſtayed all day with the king, ſomtimes in one place, ſometimes in an other, deuiſing of the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age into <hi>Guyenne,</hi> and touching that war which I ſo much affect. Mean time, (as I preſume) the king made inquirie in all places, if I were not followed by greater troupes, then that where with I entered. And hauing known (as true it was) that I came with ſo fewe, and not one ſouldier neare me by
40. myles, the next day being the 12. of May, very early in the morning, there entered into the Tovvn at <hi>S.

You will not beleeue, what great contentment this gracious good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God procured in my minde: firſt, in that I ſaw mine honour ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcharged of the ſuſpitions of ſpoyle and maſſacre, that had been put into the heads of many honeſt men againſt me, for that hauing ſeene all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and ſo happily impeached the ſame, I made all mine enemies mute. Secondly, hauing giuen proofe of my zeale to the ſeruice and honour of my king, ſo far, as to reſtore the armes that had been borne againſt me, with the drumbs and fyfes conducting the priſoners ſending them their colours, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering the beſieged, and not omitting any reſpect, which the moſt conſtant would haue done.</p>
                        <p>But they did ſo much, that they perſwaded the king to depart out of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> 24. houers after, that I would he ſhould haue ſtayed: But Cod defend that ever I ſhould thinke it. Since his departure, his Maieſtie hath had ſome other ſharper counſell, I haue receiued the
<hi>Arſenal,</hi> the <hi>Baſtille,</hi> and other ſtrong places, into my cuſtodie, I haue cauſed the coffers of his treaſures to bee ſealed, to deliuer them ſafely and peaceably into his Maieſties hands, as wee hope likewiſe to procure him vnto peace, by prayers to God, interceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his holineſſe, and all other Chriſtian Princes, for the ſpeciall &amp; not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proofe of fidelitie, he hath alwaies had of me, but if the miſchief co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue, <pb n="89" facs="tcp:22081:200"/>I hope by the ſame meanes to preſerue religion and the Catholicques, and defend them from perſecution: which the confederates, with hereticques a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the king, had prepared for them.</p>

I knowe what Garriſons meane, they are eyther placed to deſtroy a Towne, or elſe becauſe of ſome diſtruſt that is had in the Inhabitants: they ought not to thinke that I would ouerthrowe or deſtroy a Towne, to the which, I haue ſhewed ſo many ſignes of great good will, and which I haue inriched by my long continuance therein, as hauing ſtayed there more then tenne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of my predeceſſors euer did, which hath procured, yea euen to the meaneſt Artificers therein, that great trafficque which at this day they haue: and ſo much, that it might haue benefited tenne or twelue other Townes, which would haue been glad thereof: and where my officers haue had cauſe to vſe my helpe, as likewiſe Merchants and others: I haue not denied it vnto them, ſo that they may iuſtly ſay, I haue alwaies ſhewed my ſelf a good king in their behalfes: leſſe cauſe ſhould I likewiſe haue, to enter into diſtruſt of thoſe whom I loued, and of whom I might haue aſſured my ſelfe, as I verily thought. So that the amitie I bare vnto them, ought to haue bereaued them of this fond opinion, that I would place a Garriſon among them: and it is wel knowne, that not one ſouldier ſet foote or entered into any houſe, to looke eyther bread or prouiſion whatſoeuer: but to the contrary, I ſent them mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and other neceſſaries, and they had not ſtayed there aboue foure and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie houres at the furtheſt, which had been till the next day, but they ſhould haue lodge elſe where.

And therefore I will haue them to acknowledge their faults with greefe and true contrition: I knowe well that they are put in minde, and made beleeue, that hauing offended mee in that ſort, my indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is vnreconcileable: but I would haue you to let them know, that I am not ſo diſpoſed to looſe them, and as God (whoſe Image although vnwoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie I beare heere vppon earth) will not the death of a ſinner: ſo I deſire not their ouerthrow.

                  <p>I am no vſurper, I am lawfull king by ſucceſsion, as you all can teſtifie, and of a race that hath alwaies commanded with benignitie. It is in vaine to ſpeake of religion: I muſt take another courſe, there is no Prince liuing in the world, more Catholicque and deſirous of the extirpation of hereſies, then I am, which both mine actions and life hath ſhewed vnto my people.

<hi>Moyſes</hi> had neuer retained the people in their duties, among ſo many trauerſes and changes, if he had not ſpoken of <hi>Ego Dominus:</hi> and therefore Princes that deſire to liue in peace, and cauſe their eſtates to flouriſh, neuer feared any thing ſo much, as that their people ſhould leaue their opinion once conceiued of the ſeruice of God.

                     <hi>France</hi> (ſaid hee) hath beene ſuch, that after it had publicquely receiued the Chriſtian faith vnder <hi>Clouis,</hi> it hath alwaies maintained it in one courſe immutable &amp; iuuiolable:
<hi>France</hi> neuer indured the peruerſe opinions of faith within her breſt: <hi>France</hi> while all Chriſtendome was moued by the pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diuiſions of ſo diuers opinions, and with ſo many and different ſorts of hereſies, that vntill this time haue raigned, hath alwaies continued conſtant and vpright, not once bending it ſelfe to any falſe doctrine:
<hi>France</hi> hath been the ſuccor and defence of chriſtian faith, and the terror of the enemies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And to conclude, <hi>France</hi> hath beene like a rocke, or vnexprignable ſort of chriſtianitie. And how much ſhould it now bee fallen from his auncient honour, how much reputation ſhould it looſe? how much ſhould it want of her firſt fidelitie towards God, if changing her firmitie &amp; conſtancie tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching faith, it ſhould liue long in ſuch diuiſion, and indure before her eyes, <pb n="118" facs="tcp:22081:215"/>(in times paſt) ſo iealous of the vnion of chriſtian beleeſe and libertie, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an intollerable libertie, to liue vnder diuers religions.</p>
                  <p>Your Maieſtie looking into the memorie of things paſt, may ſufficiently perceiue, that as long as <hi>France</hi> hath been vnited vnder one chriſtian religion, ſhee hath made her glorie and renowne ſpred through all countries: ſhee hath cauſed her valor in armes to be prooued &amp; felt in all places of the world: ſhee hath alwaies beene victorious ouer all the enemies of Catholicque re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and hath done ſo many honourable actions, &amp; achieued ſo great and happy conqueſts againſt Inſidels, that it wanne ſuch glorie among the <hi>Aſians, Africans, Indians, Perſians, Tartarians, Moores, Sarrazins,</hi> and others, that all the chriſtians in <hi>Europe,</hi> are by them called Frenchmen: for that becauſe thoſe ſtrange nations haue onely felt the armes of Frenchmen, they haue alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended all the Latine churches, vnder the name of
<hi>France</hi> &amp; Frenchmen. But ſince <hi>France</hi> hath been diuided &amp; rent with two religions, let vs ſee how much it hath loft of her auncient renowne: ſhee that commaunded a great part of <hi>Europe,</hi> that conquered countries farre diſtant from her: that at her onely name, made diuers warrelike nations to tremble, is found ſince this vnhappy and vnfortunate diuiſion, to bee reduced into ſuch extremitie, that in the middle of her breſt, ſhe hath receiued forraine powers: ſhee hath in a manner receiued the lawe of her neighbours, and of her enemies, and that cruell, turning her ſword againſt her owne intrailes: and although ſhee was inuincible in reſpect of all other nations, ſhe is now her ſelf ſo imbaſed, van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, and ouerthrowne: which is the fruit that this venemous plant of new opinion hath induced, which ſeemeth to be at the poynt readie to giue more daungerous thruſts, if according to the expectation which your obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient people haue conceiued of your wiſdome &amp; pietie, it pleaſeth not your Maieſtie ſpeedily to take order therein.</p>
                  <p>Remember that your Grace beareth the Scepter of the great king
<hi>Clouis,</hi> that firſt ruled this Monarchie vnder the publike profeſsion of this religion, which at this preſent is put in queſtion within this Realme. Remember that you are ſucceſſor to that great
<hi>Childeberg,</hi> that being able to indure ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons about him, that had any wrong opinion of chriſtian religion, made wars vppon the
<hi>Viſigots,</hi> that were infected with the hereſie of the
<hi>Arrians,</hi> and in the end, conſtrained them to ioyne and vnite themſelues to the holy and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicque Church. Remember that you beare vpon your head, the crowne of that <hi>Charles,</hi> who for the greatneſſe and valor of his actions, deſerued the name of great, and by the vertue of his armes aduanced chriſtian religion, and defended the authoritie of the Apoſtolicque ſea, againſt ſuch as perſecuted the ſame. Remember that you hold the place of that moſt woorthieking <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip Auguſte,</hi> who with ſo much zeale &amp; affection, imployed his armes againſt
<hi>Albigeois</hi> hereticques, that had ſequeſtred themſelues from the Catholicque vnion. Remember that you ſit in the ſeate of that renowmed Prince Saint <hi>Lewis,</hi> that ſpared not his treaſures, his forces, nor his own perſon, for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and aduancement of the faith of Chriſt, and by his chriſtian actions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued the crowne and ſurname of Saint, and without prolonging time, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe them all. Remember that you are Nephew to that great king <hi>Francis,</hi> the light of the pietie of
<hi>France,</hi> ſon of that victorious <hi>Henry,</hi> whoſe memorie ſhall liue for for euer: and brother to thoſe two Catholicque Princes,
<hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, whom God hath taken to his mercie. (But <pb n="119" facs="tcp:22081:215"/>But yet againe, that which toucheth you neareſt, remember that you are that renowmed <hi>Henry,</hi> that being but Duke of <hi>Aniou,</hi> and brother to the king, did ſo valiant an act in the defence of the Church: wonne ſo many great bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, and ſo many times daunted the enemies of the Catholicque faith, that you haue filled al Chriſtendome with the wonders of your victorious name. And we think (if that like your Grace) that your M. hath not ſo ſoone forggot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that great and ſolemne oath, that you made at your coronation, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to maintaine chriſtian and Catholicque religion, but to aduance it as much as poſsible you might, without tollerating any other. And if euer any oath lid binde a Prince to maintain &amp; keep his faith, this hath ſo ſtraightly bound you, to the defence of this religion, that you cannot permit any other, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breach of conſcience: and paraduenture make a doubt of the right you haue vnto the Crowne. For you know well, that you haue agreed and contracted with Ieſus Chriſt, that you accepted the Scepter vppon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to be defendor of his Catholicque religion, and in that ſolemne oath as a gage and earneſt-penny, you receiued his holy bodie, and dranke his precious blood. And now fayling in this religious oath, thinke you he hath not good cauſe to be offended againſt you? knowe you not, that all the euils wee haue ſuffered, proceeded onely from his iuſt wrath? and ſee you not, that hauing giuen you this Scepter vppon ſuch conditions, hee threatneth to take it from you, if you keepe not the holy promiſe you made ſo ſolemnely vnto him? And euen as God ſummoneth you to the obſeruation of the faith that you haue giuen him, your ſubiects by the ſame meanes, ſolicite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite you to obſerue the conditions wherevppon you were made king, and which you cannot infringe, (breaking your oath) but if you muſt alſo looſe the title of moſt chriſtian King: and wee doubt not, that ſetting theſe things before your eyes, that reuiuing the memorie of your predeceſſors, &amp; continuing the firſt prudence and vertue, but you ſhall haue that great good fortune in your time, to ſee your people reduced to the ſheepfold of the holy and Catholicque Church, whereof you are as a father and protector.</p>
                  <p>By this meanes, thoſe great Kings of <hi>Ieruſalem, Dauid, Salomon, Abis, loſaphat, Ezechias,</hi> and <hi>Ioſias,</hi> obtained the bleſsings of God, and a happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in all their affaires: hauing with ſo great care &amp; dilligence, reſtored the puritie of religion, and reeftabliſhed diuine ſeruice that was neglected. And wee alſo hope, that following their ſteppes, you will reduce all <hi>France</hi> to the Catholicque religion: and for the recompence of your holy intent, you ſhall haue that bleſsing of God in your time, to behold your Realm as flouriſhing as euer it was. And as it ſhall bee moſt acceptable vnto God, ſo will it be moſt honourable to you and to your Crowne: and you ſhall ſufficiently perceiue, that at this day there is no King, Prince, Potentate, or Common-wealth, I except certaine Barbarians and the Turke, (whoſe deteſtable manners and cuſtomes ought to bee ſo odious, that the onely name ſhould bee a horrour vnto vs) that ſuffereth their ſubiects to liue in any other religion, then that which the Magiſtrate by the diſvnion of the Church, holdeth for onely good and holy. And ſurely ſuch are not woorthie to bee heard, that will ſo much reſtraine the power of the Prince or Magiſtrate, to ſay that hee cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine his ſubiects to the faith, but that hee ought to ſuffer them to liue in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of conſcience (as they ſay) for this opinion hath alwaies generally been
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:22081:216"/>condemned and reprooued by all Chriſtians, but only by the <hi>Manickiens</hi> and <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> that were of opinion that wee muſt not conſtraine any man for his religion, but ſuffer euery man to liue in libertie, and after his owne ſantaſie: and thoſe which at this day, in a manner by force, pull from you this libertie of their religion, permit it not to others. For in the places of Chriſtendome, where God permitteth that they ſhould bee Maiſters, and hauing the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in their hands, they are ſo farre from permitting Catholicques, freely to liue in the libertie of their conſciences, that to the contrary, the diuers ſects that are among them (for that alreadie they are banded and diuided among themſelues, an euident ſigne of their ruine at hand) cannot indure each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And there where the <hi>Calueniſt</hi> is Maiſter, the
<hi>Lutheriau</hi> dareth not liue freely: yea, and when they change Magiſtrates of diuers opinions, religion changeth according to his pleaſure: as we haue ſeene ſufficient of ſuch chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in England, and in many places in <hi>Germanie.</hi> And what? ſhould not this bee a ſhame and too great a ſlaunder to a good chriſtian and faithfull Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licque, to bee found leſſe affected in his religion, that is approued by ſo long and continuall ſucceſsion, then theſe new chriſtians in their opinions, that are as it were but one night olde? It is then a generall and certaine maxime, and approoued by the Church, and by all Common-wealths, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ought and may continue his people vnder one faith, as it is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeene by ſo many godly lawes and conſtitutions of Chriſtian and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licque Empires: and by the kings your predeceſſors: whoſe examples ought to bee holy and inuiolate, vnto your Maieſtie. Such were the reaſons of the League, by the vehemencie whereof, the king diſpoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to warre, reſeruing alwaies a continuall thought, to rid himſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But the Queene, that ſawe ſo many accidents to hang like leade ouer his head, that thought the great and proude Spaniſh armie would land in <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi> and that all the territories of
<hi>Italie</hi> would fall vppon him, to defend the Catholicqueleague, did ſo much, that the king diſſembled the wound in his heart, and ſaid: that hee had no more remembrance of the hard dealings that had paſt: that he had no other intent but that of the League, which was to extirpe hereſie.</p>
                  <p>Vppon this aſſurance, the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> cauſed his merchandiſes to bee liked, and to bee more eſteemed then they were woorth, or then hee hoped. Wherevppon hee entered into a treatie with the Queen-mother, and with her reſolued vppon certaine articles, vppon the fifteenth of Iuly, which the king approoued, receiued, and ſigned, within three daies after, which were as followeth.</p>

                     <p>So the king not to diſpleaſe the League, that occupied the principall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his thoughts, declared the Cardinall of

                     <p>In the firſt, the wicked Councellours and adminiſtrators of the publike treaſures, were examined and openly named, with a moſt ſhamefull defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

Nor yet for the pronunciation of Orations, with more grace &amp; eloquence, then in this God that is the iuſt diſtributer of his fauours to whom it pleaſeth him, hath ordained, that nature ſhould helpe and adorne certaine nations, more then others with eloquence of ſpeech, but it is a ſpeciall fauour of God, to ſpeake well and to the purpoſe, before great aſſemblies, not of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Veniſe,</hi> nor a Councel of three hundreth in the cantons of Swiſſes, but before the eſtates of a great king: yea of the greateſt Realme in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, and in the preſence of the geateſt king of all <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This eloquence is a gift of God, ſuch and ſo great, that

For that eloquence is like a medicine, which is onely prepared for ſicke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and eloquence is imployed but in ſuch eſtates, that are like to fall and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, and to mooue and perſwade a people that are ſtayed.</p>

                  <p>Seeing then that you ſee mee ſo fully bent to procure this peace and common tranquilitie of my eſtate, and that you cannot alleadge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to the contrary, ingraue it likewiſe in your mindes, and iudge well of mee, in regard of thoſe that would haue proceeded in other ſort,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:22081:231"/>Withall noting, that whatſoeuer lintend, cannot in any ſort bee eſteemed or attributed, as any wales pretending, to authoriſe my ſelfe either againſt lawe or reaſon: for I am your king ordained by God, and bee onely that may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and lawfully challenge that right. And therfore I deſire not to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted other in this Monarchie then as I am, not beeing able to wiſh or deſire more honour or authoritie, then that I haue alreadie obtained. Fauour then I pray you (my good ſubiects) this true intent, which tendeth onely to the furtherance and aduancement of the honour of God, and our wholly Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licque, Apoſtolike, and Romiſh religion, to extirpe hereſies in all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces of this Realm, and therin to reeſtabliſh all good order &amp; gouernment: to comfort my poore people ſo much oppreſſed, and to erect my authoritie vniuſtly imbaſed: which I deſire not ſo much for mine owne proper intereſt, as for the good that thereby may redound vnto you all. Among all kindes of gouernments and commaundements ouer men, the Monarchie excelleth all the reſt: and the profit which you and yours haue reaped, vnder the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full gouernments of my predeceſſors, forceth you continually to render thankes to God, that it hath pleaſed him to giue you life in ſuch a time, and vnder ſuch a Prince, who beeing of the ſame race, hath not onely enioyed their royall ſeate, but the ſame and greater zeale, (if poſsible it may be) to the augmentation of the glorie of our God, and the conſeruation of you all, as I haue alwaies promiſed, that mine actions ſhould wholly tend therevnto. That miſchiefe which malice &amp; tract of time hath induced into my Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ought not ſo much to bee atributed vnto mee, (not that I ſeeke wholly to excuſe my ſelfe) as to the negligence, and peraduenture ſome other faults of thoſe that heeretofore haue been aſsiſtant vnto mee, wherein I haue already begunne to take order, as you may well perceiue, but I aſſure you, that from hencefoorth, I will bee ſo circumſpect, in making choiſe of thoſe that ſerue me, that my conſcience ſhall bee diſcharged, mine honour inceaſed, and my eſtate reeſtabliſhed, to the contentment of all good people, and thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine thoſe (who againſt all reaſon haue placed their affections on others, and not on mee) to acknowledge their errors.</p>
                  <p>The teſtimonies are yet ſufficient and manifeſt, and namely by the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of many of you, (as reaping honour by aſsiſting mee therein) both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and ſince I haue beene your king, to ſhew with what zeale and forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe I haue alwaies proceeded for the extirpation of hereticques and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, wherein I will more then euer, expoſe my bodie, yea euen to a certaine death, if neede requireth, for the defence and protection of our Catholicque, Apoſtolike, and Romane faith: the ouerthrow of hereſies beeing the moſt ſumptuous tombe wherein my body may be laid, not the battels only which I haue wonne, but that great ouerthrow and abating of the pride of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of Rutters: wherevnto Cod, for the honour of his holy name and of his Church, had choſen mee for an inſtrument, are ſufficient proofes, the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs and ſpoyles whereof are yet extant to be ſeene.</p>
                  <p>Is there any one then ſo vncapable of the trueth, that will ſuppoſe more zeale and ardent deſire to bee in man, for the totall extirpation of ſuch he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, when more certaine ſignes then mine of ſuch intents cannot bee found?</p>
                  <p>And if it ſhould be, that the honor of God (which to me is dearer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my life) <pb n="152" facs="tcp:22081:232"/>not ſo much eſteemed of by me, whoſe patrimony do the hereticques occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and diſſeuer, whoſe reuenues doo they take vp and receiue, from whom do they alienate the ſubiects, whoſe obedience do they deſpiſe, whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, authoritie, and dignitie, doo they violate? And ſhould not I then as much or more then any man, ſeeke their deſtruction: open your eyes, and iudge particularly, what apparance may bee therein.</p>
                  <p>The revnion of all my Catholicque ſubiects, by the holy Edict, not long ſince made, hath ſufficiently teſtified, that nothing hath had more force within me, then to ſee God onely honoured, reuerenced, and ſerued, within my Realm, which I had more proceeded in, (as god willing I purpoſe to do, euen with the hazard of my life) if I had not beene hindered by this diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on moued by the Catholicques, (to the great aduantage of hereticques) ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my voyage into <hi>Poitou,</hi> where I am of opinion, that good fortune would no more haue abandoned mine actions, then it had done in other places, whereby (God bee thanked) mine eſtate hath reaped both the neceſſarie and deſired benefit.</p>
                  <p>And although I am perſwaded, you will not omit any one poynt, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the reſtoring and reformation of this Realme, yet will I make known vnto you, by ſome ſpeciall things, how much I am moſt earneſtly bent (not onely by this which I will now vtter, but by the effects that ſhall enſue) to imbrace all good meanes, as I am bound, eſteeming them moſt requiſite, for the neceſsitie and vrgent vſes thereof, both for our ſoules, our honours, and our eſtate.</p>
                  <p>The extream offence which daily is committed againſt God, by ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and blaſpheming, to him ſo much iniurious, and wholly againſt my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, cauſeth mee to put you all in minde, not to forget the iuſt puniſhments that ſuch blaſphemies deſerueth: which my deſire is, ſhould bee reformed without fauour or exception either of perſon or quallitie. The inquirie and puniſhment of ſimony, ſhall not (as it becommeth all good Chriſtians) bee forgotten, neither yet the order which is requiſite, touching the ſale and multiplicitie of iudicial offices, as being pernicious and inſupportable to my poore ſubiects, wherein had it not been for the troubles begunne in Anno. 1585, I had of my ſelfe taken ſome order: but now I expect from you the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and good meanes therein to bee vſed: as in the diſtribution and prouiſion of benefices, iudiciall and other officices, of honour, charge, eſtate, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: in this Realme, there conſiſteth that (which is dearer vnto me then life it ſelfe) mine honour, the preſeruation and ſplendure of this eſtate, and the good will of all my ſubiects towards me: to the end, that ſuch things may be done with more deliberation, I meane from hence forward, to appoynt ſome certaine times, which ſhall bee made knowne vnto you, and therein ſo to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute them with iuſt conſideration of each mans deſert, as in dutie I am bound, as reaſon requireth, my reputation reſtraineth mee, and as the good I wiſh to this eſtate, forceth me vnto: minding that from this time forward, euery man ſhall hold that good and honour hee hath, only from me: and for their better meanes to obtaine them at my hands, I will take order for their more eaſie acceſſe vnto my perſon, according to the times and houres I will imploy to that end.</p>
                  <p>I likewiſe will all my ſubiects, to determine and reſolue with themſelues, <pb n="153" facs="tcp:22081:233"/>to liue as vprightly, affectionately, and faithfully, in ſuch offices as ſhall bee committed to their charges, as ſhall be requiſite for the diſcharge of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and their owne: wherein from hencefoorth I am not determined to indure any defects, reſtraining my ſelfe by oath, neuer to graunt reſeruation of any thing whatſoeuer, reuoking ſuch as heeretofore haue been graunted, and from this time foorth, declaring them of no force, intending not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue them, as things that may bee preiudiciall, and meanes to mooue men eyther to deſire or purchaſe the deaths of other men, and vngodly both in my ſelfe, and in ſuch as ſeeke to obtaine them.</p>
                  <p>I will likewiſe giue no more ſuruiuings, determining, that concerning thoſe alreadie graunted, I am minded to referre my ſelfe therein to your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. It is moſt neceſſary to reſtraine euocations, graunts, remiſsions, and abolitions, that iuſtice ſhould bee more prompt, and leſſe chargeable to the people, and that crimes may bee exactly puniſhed. You muſt not likewiſe forget the inriching of Arts and Sciences: the beautifying and repairing of the Townes within my Realme: the gouernments and ordering of trade and trafficque of Merchandiſes, as well by land as by ſea, and the reſtraining of vſurie, with ſuperfluities and exceſſe of things that are riſen to moſt high priſes. The reſtoring and renuing of ancient ordinances touching the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and dignitie of the ſoueraigne Prince, with the reuerence due vnto him and his Magiſtrates, which you ſhall determine as reaſon requireth. The iuſt feare that you might haue after my death, to fall into the gouernment of an hereticque king, if it chance that God ſhould not grant me any heires males, is not more conſidered of by you, then by me.</p>
                  <p>And I proteſt before God, that I haue not more care of mine owne ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaion, then deſire to bereaue you of that feare, which is one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall cauſes that mooued mee to make my holy Edict of vnion, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh that damnable hereſie, which although I haue moſt holily and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely ſworne, before him that giueth man conſtancie, inuiolable to holde and obſerue all good and holy oathes. I am determined the more to eſtabliſh it, that it ſhould bee made one of the fondamentall lawes of our Realme, and that vppon the next Tueſday, in this place, and before the notable aſſembly of all my eſtates, I will that euery man ſhall ſweare vnto it, to the end that none may heereafter pretend any cauſe of ignorance.</p>
                  <p>And our holy deſires may not vainly be fruſtrate for want of meanes: I determine to take ſuch order therein, by the counſell which you ſhall giue mee, that as the deſert ſhall not conſiſt in mee, it may not likewiſe proceede from the ſmall aſsiſtance by you giuen therevnto, whereby the effects of our deſires may bee in force.</p>
                  <p>By my holy Edict of vnion, all leagues, but ſuch as are made by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie from mee, ought not to bee ſuffered, and although it did not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbidde the ſame, yet neither Cod nor dutie doth permit it, as beeing wholly againſt it, for that all leagues, aſſociations, practiſes, deuiſes, intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, leuyings of men and mony, and receits of the ſame, as well within as without this Realme, are actions of a king, and in all well gouerned Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narches, eſteemed high treaſon if they bee done without the Princes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. And although by word of mouth (thereby witneſsing my accuſtomed clemencie in that reſpect) to omit all forepaſſed faultes, yet as dutie bindeth <pb n="154" facs="tcp:22081:233"/>mee and you all, (to conſerue the royall eſtate) hauing taken order for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing of certaine lawes, to bee made by my eſtates, I will by theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents declare, and from hencefoorth pronounce as guiltie of high treaſon, all ſuch my ſubiects as deſiſt not from them, or that in any ſort dealeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, without my authoritie and conſent, graunted vnder the great Seale of <hi>France.</hi> Wherein I am aſſured that you will not faile, to ſhewe your faiths and fidelities, counſelling and requiring at my handes, to renue and fortifie this faire and auncient law, ingrafted within the hearts of all true French men that defend the ſame: which I will ſhall bee ſet downe in expreſſe words: I am bound thereby both vnto my ſelfe, and to my Realme: and you to mee: and to the ſtate of the land, which you now repreſent: wherevnto in preſence of the Almightie God, I ſummon you all.</p>
                  <p>In times paſt, the goodly order and exact pollicie obſerued among our ſouldiers, bredde and procured an admiration and terror of my nation, togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a particular and honourable glory to all our French Nobilitie.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore weed eſire, that the ſame honour wherewith wee haue beene admired aboue all nations, may ſtill bee maintained: wherein I will ſpare no paines whatſoeuer: and the like I craue of you, whereby the wrath of God beeing appeaſed, and that our forces may bee vſed to the preſeruation, and not to the deſtruction of our eſtate, thereby procuring ſo much content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and comfort to my ſubiects, as that hereafter they may as willingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire our ſouldiers both horſe and footemen for their gifts, as they now feare and abhorre them, and that with great reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I am much greeued that I cannot maintaine my eſtate and royall dignitie, with the neceſſary charges of this Realme without mony: for mine owne particular, it is the thing that leaſt greeueth mee, but it is a neceſſary euill: warres likewiſe cannot bee well followed without mony, and ſeeing at this preſent wee are in a good courſe, to extirpe accurſed hereſies, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary we ſhould prouide great ſummes of mony to furniſh our expenſes: for want whereof (to ſay the trueth) our leuyings of men will bee more to our hinderances then our profits, and yet there can be no exployt done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them.</p>
                  <p>For my part therefore I promiſe, not to ſpare any meanes whatſoeuer: wherein likewiſe I craue that zeale of you, which you haue alwaies aſſured mee to beare vnto the ſeruice of God, and the commoditie of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>
                  <p>And therefore you muſt (ſhewing you the full reuenues of my whole eſtate) haue that conſideration, that the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> had of an Emperour, who deſiring (as I doo) to ſuppreſſe all ſubſidies, ſhewed him, that ſuch le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyings of treaſure, were the ſinues and vaines of the body of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, which beeing taken away, it would preſently deſolue and be vnlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                  <p>And yet I ſay, that I would to God, that the neceſsitie of my eſtate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained mee not to vſe them: and that at one inſtant, I might gratifie my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with ſo goodly a preſent, as alſo that my daies might be abridged, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to liue any longer, then that my life might be profitable and aduantage to the ſeruice of God, and all your preſeruations.</p>
                  <p>Touching the order required for the diſpoſing of my treaſures, ſo much <pb n="155" facs="tcp:22081:233"/>for the comfort and eaſe of my people, whether it bee concerning the ouer great numbers of officers, or other particularities, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded you will take as good order by your wiſedomes, as ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, as beeing one of the principall pillers, whereby wee and all our eſtate in generall, for the moſt part are ſupported.</p>
                  <p>It is likewiſe a matter of conſcience (that toucheth our ſoules healths) to take order for our debts, which I haue not altogither made, but bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing debts of our Realme, you ought to haue a care thereof, wherevnto both publicque faith and wiſedome, bindeth you all, and you ſhall bee certified what they are.</p>
                  <p>The King beeing the patron, whereby all his ſubiects learne to frame their actions, it is therefore, that of my naturall inclination, I will ſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne mine owne perſon and my houſe, that from hencefoorth they ſhall ſerue for a rule and example to all the reſt of my Realme and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>And to the end I may witneſſe by effect, that which you deſire of mee, and which is moſt deepely ingraued within my heart, touching this great aſſembly (hauing fully determined vpon your memorialles and billes) which I deſire you, may bee done with all the ſpeede you can, and with your good counſelles and aduiſe (as I will ſhew vnto you,) the next day after in open audience in the Church, that it may bee knowne to all my ſubiects, and ſo holde it for an inuiolable and firme lawe, whereby no man may withſtand it but with ſhame and infamie, and vppon paine to bee acceſſary of high treaſon, as an enemie to this countrie, I meane by oath vppon the Euangeliſtes, to binde all the Princes, Lordes, and Gentlemen, that are aſsiſtant at this Parliament, togither with you the Deputies of my eſtates, and therevppon you ſhall receiue the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to obſerue all the thinges that therein are contained, as ſacred lawes, not reſeruing vnto my ſelfe the libertie of exemption from the ſame, for any cauſe, pretence, or occaſion whatſoeuer may heereafter happen.</p>
                  <p>Which done, I will preſently cauſe it to bee ſent into all the Courts of Parliament throughout my Realme, to ſweare all Eccleſiaſticall, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and common perſons therevnto, with this clauſe, that whoſoeuer oppoſeth himſelfe againſt it, ſhall alwaies bee holden as a notorious trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
                  <p>And if heerein I ſeeme to ſubmit my ſelfe more then becommeth mee, vnto the lawes whereof I am the Authour, and which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues diſpence with mee therein, and that by this meanes, I reduce my rovall eſtate to more certaine termes and poynts, then that of my prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors: It is the principall cauſe that maketh the generous minde of the Prince beſt knowne and diſcerned, to addreſſe and frame his thoughts and actions vnto his good lawes, and wholly to oppoſe himſelfe againſt the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions thereof: and it will ſuffice mee to make anſwere therevnto, as that King did (to whom it was tolde, that hee ſought to leaue his royaltie in woorſe eſtate to his ſucceſſors, then hee enioyed it from his predeceſſors) that he would make it much more durable and aſſured then euer it was.</p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:22081:234"/>
                  <p>But to end my long diſcourſe, hauing vſed authoritie and commaundement, I will now proceede to exhortations and prayers: and firſt I charge you all, by the dutie you owe to God, by whom I am appoynted and ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted ouer you, to repreſent his perſon, by the name of true Frenchmen, (that is of paſsionate louers of their naturall and lawefull Prince,) by the aſhes of the memories of ſo many Kings my Predeceſſours, that haue ſo louingly and happily ruled and gouerned ouer you: by the charitie that you beare vnto your Countrie, by the boundes and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages it hath of your fidelities, your wiues, your children, and your domeſticall fortunes, that with all your hearts you imbrace this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: that you bee wholly and altogither carefull for the Common-wealth: that you vnite and ioyne your ſelues with mee, to ſtriue againſt the diſorders and corruptions of this eſtate, by your ſufficiencie, by your integritie, and by your greate care and diligence, abandoning and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking all contrary thoughts, (and following onely my example,) not hauing any other deſire, then the onely good of the Common-wealth, and as my ſelfe beeing eſtraunged from all other ambition, then that onely which concerneth and toucheth a ſubiect, as I my ſelfe beare no other minde, then that which belongeth vnto a good, faithfull, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King.</p>
                  <p>If you doo otherwiſe, you ſhall bee filled with all accurſedneſſe, you will imprint a perpetuall ſpot of infamie in your poſteritie and names, and alſo bereaue your poſteritie of that ſucceſsiue name and title of ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie towardes your King, which by your aunceſtors hath been ſo careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left vnto you.</p>
                  <p>And for mine owne parte, I will take heauen and earth to witneſſe, and I will bee iudged both by God and man, that it is not my fault, nor any want of diligence in mee, that the diſorders of this Realme, haue not beene long ſince reformed, but that you are the onely cauſe, by forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king your lawefull Prince, in ſo woorthie, ſo holy, and ſo commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an action.</p>

                  <p>But God forbidde, that I ſhould euer thinke it, but rather conceiue that you will rule your ſelues therein, (as I perſwade my ſelfe) with wiſedome, affection, loue, and fidelitie, wherein you ſhall do good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice vnto God, and alſo to your King, you ſhall bee bleffed in this world, and thereby obtaine the name of couſeruators of your lande and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>

                  <p>The king in the meane time, that feared to bee preuented, not minding any longer to delay his purpoſe, thought to execute it at a ſupper, which the Archbiſhop of <hi>Lyons</hi> ſhould make both him and the Cardinall his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vppon the Sunday before Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> day, but hee referred the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vntill the Tueſday following, the Duke of

                  <p>Two daies after the execution, the ſixteenth diſplayed their olde co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and cried out: murther, fire, and vengeance: they preſently made a collection of monies to maintaine warres, the pooreſt artificer among them, was content to impart at leaſt ſixe Crownes, &amp; ſome hauing no mony, (that they might not bee found without affection to that commotion) ſolde and pawnde their goods, to bee contributaries vnto it: golde ranne like a riuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the ſtreetes: they found hidden treaſures, and it ſeemed that <hi>France</hi> had nouriſhed theeues, to make an almaſſe of treaſures, for thoſe inraged people. <hi>Parris</hi> became the infamous Theater of rebellion, wherein the ſixteenth like furies iſſuing out of hell, ſhewed the fier and flame wherewith they inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and murthered the poore countrie of <hi>France.</hi> Vnder thoſe mad dogges, and ſtinking impoſtumes of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth, was practiſed the moſt fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie and ſtraungeſt riſing that euer troubled the eſtate of any Towne. To pleaſe the ſixteenth, they muſt diſpleaſe God, their king, &amp; their own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. He was but hardly thought on, that had not halfe a dozen of great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, wherewith to deteſt that execution, and an elegie for the memorie of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and all with the moſt ſad &amp; ſorrowfull countenance that might be deuiſed: withall, powring out ſome notorious and blaſphemous oathes, the better to counterfet a diſliking.

                  <p>There was no fooliſh Poet nor Ballet-ſinger within
<hi>Parris,</hi> that deuiſed not one couple of ſongs touching this action, nor any Preacher, that found not one place in his ſermon, wherein to vtter a multitude of iniuries againſt the king.

                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was one of the faireſt Princes of the Court, big &amp; high of proportion, an amiable face, ſo quicke of eye, that therby he pearced into all places,<note place="margin">Plut, in the notable ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Kings, Princes and Captains.</note> to know and chuſe out his ſeruants fartheſt diſtant from him, and in the greateſt preaſe. <hi>Caezar</hi> increaſed in ambition, as wel as in yeares, in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of courage, as well as in bodie.

                  <p>But <hi>Commeronde,</hi> for his firſt warrelike exployt, burned the Gates of the Church: afterwards hee entered thereinto with his people, which wholly pilled and ſpoyled it, killed a poore man at the crucifix foot, becauſe he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that in the ſelf ſame place they had rauiſhed his wife in his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: they eaſed their bellies within the holy water ſtocke, and in euery cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Church: and of robes, wherein were wrought certaine <hi>Aue Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> they made garments for change, and ſetting foorth of their queanes.

               <p>This did truely preſage and ſhew vnto them, what ſucceſſe they were like to haue in their attempts to come, whereof followed nothing elſe but ſhame and ſorrow to the leaguers.</p>

               <p>The furie of theſe ſkirmiges was at laſt conuerted to the playing of the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, both on the one ſide and the other, which indured three or foure dayes togither.</p>
               <p>On the Thurſday the three and twentieth of September, the Leaguers Armie, or a part thereof, containing a thouſand horſe, and about ſix, or eight thouſand foote, came to a place named <hi>la Maladerie:</hi> which was ſtrengthened with eight hundred ſmal ſhot, foure co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies of Rutters &amp; Lanceknights: ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained moreouer with three companies of light horſmen, three companies of great ordenance, and with the forces of the Princes of <hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Counte.</hi> Furthermore at the top of the Trench, ſtood the companies belonging to the Lords of <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> and <hi>Maligni:</hi> with a good number of the Nobilitie who were vnder the Marſhall of <hi>Birons</hi> charge. The Leaguers beginning then a bloodie skirmage, it was moſt valiantly held out by the kings troupes, at what time in the firſt aſſault <hi>Monſieur Sagonne,</hi> a principall man of the Leaugue, was ſlaine, with diuers of his horſmen, the reſt were put to flight. But they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming with a freſh ſupply, the kings wearied ſouldiers were forced to retire. There the Switzers who was of the Regiment of <hi>Monſieur de Soleurre,</hi> vnder the Collonell <hi>Galati,</hi> did ſtay and withſtand the furie of the Leaguers, being ayded by certaine harguebuziers which were lodged in places of aduantage, and by the Cannon which played vpon the Leaguers. And while this ſecond charge was preparing, the Leaguers Lance-knights drew near vnto the tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, declaring that they would yeeld themſelues to the king. And after ſome ſpeech on both ſides, though many French Gentlemen were of an other opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, they were at laſt receiued. But while the kings Maieſtie, with <hi>Monſieur de Biron,</hi> and their troupes of horſemen, fought here and there, theſe Lance-knights perceiuing clearely the great power of the Leaguers,<note place="margin">The falſhood of the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers Lance-knights.</note> togither with the Switzers, iudged in themſelues that the king was alreadie halfe vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: and vpon this imagination, they began to turne their weapons againſt him. Then receiuing the words, they lighted vppon the Marſhall <hi>de Birons</hi> troupe, and beating away the moſt part of the ſouldiers there, they tooke the Enſignes of the Switzers and Lance-knights belonging to the king: then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering this Trench to the Leaguers, it was ſuddainly repaired by them: but they held it not very long. For the Duke <hi>de Montpenſier</hi> beeing come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his Cornet of Horſe, and an other company of the vantgard of his men of warre: being alſo aſsiſted by <hi>Monſieur de Chaſtillon,</hi> with a freſh ſupply of fiue hundreth harguebuziers.</p>
               <p>The Leaguers were conſtrained to depart both from
<hi>Maladere</hi> and the Trench: where the king ſpeedily brought two great peeces of Ordenance, which he cauſed to be ſhot off among the thickeſt of the Switzers his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: who with certaine of the horfmen made a retrait, in the which they were mightily damnified by the great ſhot: neuertheleſſe they neuer tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their faces to looke backe, whereby they might ſee from whence their hurt came. This day the Leaguers loſt a great number of ſouldiers and men of warre, among whom were diuers of their chiefe Gentlemen, and many were taken priſoners.</p>
               <p>The King loſt alſo ſixe or ſeuen Gentlemen, with the Earle of <hi>Rouſsie,</hi> and a fewe footemen. There were many hurt by the traiterous practiſe of the Leaguers Lance-knights.</p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:22081:276"/>
               <p>On Sunday the foure and twentieth, the Leaguers armie raiſed themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout midnight: and vpon the Tueſday following, they came vpon the other ſide of the Towne of <hi>Arques,</hi> and ſet ſemſelues right againſt the place from whence they were parted, aſſaying to batter it with cannon ſhot. But the king found the leaguers ſo much worke, by continuall skirmiges, and hampered them in ſuch ſort, that vppon the eleuenth day after their comming thither, they were faine ſhamefully to withdraw themſelues from the Towne of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques:</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the news which they receiued, that the Earle <hi>de Soiſſon,</hi> the D. <hi>de Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueuille,</hi> and the Marſhal <hi>d'Aumont,</hi> were comming within twentie leagues of <hi>Arques</hi> with their troupes, to ſtrengthen the king in his forces. While theſe affairs were in hand, the leaguers to make the Pariſians beleeue great things, and dreame of wonders, ſent the Enſignes thither, which they had taken from the kings Switzers and Lance-knights, as a token of the good ſucceſſe which they had againſt his Maieſtie. Wherevppon there was a certaine pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet imprinted at <hi>Parris,</hi> wherein it was publiſhed, that betweene <hi>Arques</hi> and <hi>Deepe,</hi> where the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> was beſieged, the Duke <hi>de Maine</hi> had wonne from them, foureteene Enſignes of the footemen, and eight Cornets of their horſemen were by him ſlaine.</p>
               <p>Theſe groſe fables were ſet out, to feed the people with vaine fancies, and to pinch the purſes of thoſe that were readie to beleeue it, and that bare a good deſire to haue it ſo. The king thought at the firſt, that this retrait was but a pollicie wrought by the Duke <hi>de Maine,</hi> that bending himſelfe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept his ſuccours before they came vnto him, hee might the eaſier ſubuert them, and afterward returne with more ſtrength and furie then before. For this cauſe the king reſolued with himſelfe to ioyne the Earle of <hi>Soiſſon</hi> and the others togither. After the which, leauing the Marſhall of <hi>Biron</hi> at
<hi>Deepe,</hi> his Maieſtie with foure hundreth horſe met and ioyned with his ſuccours, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in fiue myles of the leaguers armie: who with them incontinent paſſed ouer the riuer of <hi>Somme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>de Maine</hi> was faine for his credits ſake, to couer this his ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full retrait with a quaint excuſe. He therefore publiſhed abroad, that he was conſtrained ſpeedily to go down into
<hi>Picardte</hi> to poſſeſſe himſelfe of thoſe Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which hee was bound (by the agreement made at <hi>Arras</hi>) to deliuer to the Spaniards. Vpon this newes the king determined to ſtay the returne of the leaguers, beeing perſwaded that the Cities of <hi>Picardie</hi> would not be drawne to conſent in any wiſe to ſubmit themſelues vnder the Spaniſh troupes. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing then prouided for his affaires in <hi>Normandie,</hi> and gathered togither thoſe ſuccours which the Queen of England had ſent vnto him: he departed out of thoſe parts the one and twentieth of October, with full purpoſe to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Leaguers in <hi>Picardie,</hi> and to conſtraine their chiefe commaunders to auoyde that countrie, where by treaſon they had taken the Towne of <hi>Fere,</hi> and after deliuered it to the Spaniards. This done, his Maieſtie by caſie iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes drew neare vnto
<hi>Parris,</hi> and incamped himſelfe within a league there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, vpon the laſt day of the ſame moneth.</p>
               <p>The ſame day, hauing knowne what trenches the enemies had made round about the Subburbes, on that ſide where hee was, by the aduiſe of his warrelike Councell, they concluded to aſſayle them on the morrow by
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:22081:276"/>breake of day by three ſeuerall companies, and in three ſundrie places. The firſt companie conſiſted of foure thouſand Engliſhmen, two French Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and one regiment of Switzers: who were led by the Marſhall <hi>de Biron,</hi> to aſſaile that ſide of the ſubburbes called Saint <hi>Victor</hi> and <hi>Marceau.</hi> The ſecond companie hauing two Regiments of Switzers, foure of Frenchmen, and foure of ſtrangers, were all vnder the conduct of the Marſhall <hi>d'Aumont:</hi> for that part of the Subburbes called Saint <hi>Iaques</hi> and Saint
<hi>Michael.</hi> The third companie conſiſted of tenne Regiments of Frenchmen, one Regiment of Launce-knights, and one Regiment of Switzers, who were commanded by the two Lords, <hi>Chaſtillon</hi> and <hi>la Noue.</hi> Each one of theſe troupes were winged with a good number of hardie Gentlemen on foote, well armed and appoynted to aſsiſt the reſt of the footemen, if any cauſe of reſiſtance were: and theſe ſet vppon that part of the ſubburbes called Saint <hi>Germaine, Buſſi,</hi> and
<hi>Neſle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe had at their taile, two cannons and two coluerins: the king com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded ouer one of the troupes, the Earle of <hi>Soiſſon,</hi> and the Duke <hi>de Longueuille</hi> ouer the other twaine. The firſt day of Nouember, all theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbes were aſſaulted and taken in leſſe then one houre, with the loſſe of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or eight hundreth men on the defendants ſide.</p>
               <p>They loſt beſide foureteene of their Enſignes, and thirteene peeces of artillerie, ſmall and great. The aſſaylants loſt almoſt nothing at all, and if the ordenance hadde beene well mounted, the gates of <hi>Parris</hi> hadde beene battered downe, eare the Cittizens hadde knowne of any ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployt.</p>
               <p>The king entered within the ſubburbes of Saint
<hi>Iaques,</hi> about 8. of the clocke in the morning: and beeing aduertiſed that the Duke <hi>de Maine</hi> was come foorth of <hi>Picardie,</hi> and with all his forces hadde entered into <hi>Parris,</hi> made a proofe to winne the other part of the ſubburbes, which hee onely did to drawe his foes to the fight. Hauing then ſtayed foure long houres in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and that none of the leaguers would iſſue foorth: hee contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe that he had giuen knowledge to the Pariſians, that at the leaſt, meanes failed him not to chaſtiſe them, but his deſire was, to winne them by gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the acknowledgement of their faults.</p>
               <p>Therefore without more adoo, the king departed thence, and lodged about ſixe or ſeuen myles off, at a place called <hi>Linats,</hi> which is a Town aboue <hi>Montleheri,</hi> where his grace ſtayed one whole day, to ſee if his enemies had any deſire to cometo fight. But in ſtead thereof, the leaguers did the woorſt they could to the poore Pariſians, robbing and murthering many Houſhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, whom they accuſed to take part with the king, which they did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pittying either ſexe or age.</p>
               <p>They maſſacred and drowned at that time, a great number of men and women, whom (as I ſaid) they accuſed to fauour the kings forces, hauing no colour at all of any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>The king tooke within eight daies after, both the Cittie and Caſtle of <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> where hee receiued a ſupplication in writing from the Queene <hi>Dowager,</hi> wherin ſhee deſired iuſtice for the cruell murther committed on the perſon of the deceaſed king.</p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:22081:277"/>
               <p>The which petition his Maieſtie ſent to the Parliament at
<hi>Tours,</hi> enioyning them to cauſe proceſſe to be drawne againſt the offenders, to the end, that in his owne preſence, they might ſoone after receiue iudgement. Moreouer, the King added, that for his part, notwithſtanding the iuſt ſute proſecuted by the ſaid Queene, he would not faile to do the beſt that lay in him: whereupon, he vowed again in the preſence of all the Princes, Lords, and Gentlemen, which were about his royall perſon, to imploy his whole power and ſtrength, vntill he had inflicted that iuſt vengeance which God had ordained him to take.</p>
               <p>The Nobilitie alſo renewed their promiſe and proteſtations, neuer to leaue off armes, till they had reuenged the vilde death of the deceaſed King. After this, on the tenth of Nouember, the King tooke his way to <hi>Beauſſe:</hi> and on the morrow, hee came to
<hi>Ianuille:</hi> from thence arriuing at <hi>Chaſteaudun,</hi> he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<hi>Vendoſme</hi> to bee ſummoned, and to open the gates vnto him: which is a Citie of his owne patrimony. There was in that Towne one <hi>Benchard,</hi> which held it againſt the king, hauing therein the command of twelue hundred men, Citizens and ſtrangers: and when they had choſen the fitteſt places for battery, in the morning by breake of day, the artillerie began to play vpon them. The impatient ſouldiers did no ſooner ſpie a breache in the wall of foure foote wide, but preſentlie they ran and entred it, ſo that in leſſe then halfe an houre, they were maiſters of the Caſtle (into the which they made their firſt entrie) and of the Cittie, which was greatlie ſpoyled. Then was <hi>Benchard</hi> and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Fryer take and put to death, who had beene the cheefe of this rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Sedictous perſons put to death.</note>The morrow after the taking in of this Towne, the King cauſed all the ſouldiers and men of warre to be ſent from thence, appointing that the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitaunts ſhould there againe poſſeſſe theyr owne houſes, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther raunſome. Moreouer hee permitted that all their Cleargie men ſhould bee placed in their former charges and benefices, wherein afterward they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued more peaceablie (without compariſon) then they did before vnder the League.</p>
               <p>This example of iuſtice and mercie, ſaued the liues of more then a thouſand men: For the people of foure or fiue ſmall Villages which ſtood there round about, who hadde proteſted to looſe their liues in defence of the holy Vnion, hereuppon became more wiſe, and humblie ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues (in leſſe then foure or fiue dayes) to the Kings good and mercifull hands.</p>
               <p>The Towne and Caſtle of <hi>Lauardin</hi> did firſt begin in thoſe parts to ſhewe themſelues obedient: whereupon it followed, that the Townes of <hi>Montoir, Montrichard,</hi> and the Caſtle of <hi>Loyer</hi> did the like: who willinglie opened their gates to the Marſhall <hi>de Biron.</hi>

Albeit that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in fewe daies before, both hee and his, made as though they would rather die in fight at once, then they would giue enterance to the king. This being done, it was a ſtraunge thing to conſider what expences they had put the poore people vnto, of whom they hadde receiued aboue fiftie thouſand Crownes, for the fortifying of the Towne and Subburbes, in which Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbes they had burned more houſes, then came to an hundreth thouſand thouſand crownes, hauing alſo ſpoyled the countrie ſix times more: to reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Now, for ſo much as the day was ſpent, both the armies repaired to their lodgings. By the breake of day following, which was the fourteenth of March, the king by aduiſe of his Councell, determined how to order his battell.
<note place="margin">The battell of Yurie, and the kings notable exploicts.</note>And after they had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended all their ſucceſſe vnto God, he broke his faſt: and ſo about nine of the clocke in the foorenoone, they were in the field readie to giue battell: and the king beeing at the head of his ſquadron, (of which the firſt ranckes were compoſed of Princes, Earles, Knights, and principall Gentlemen of the nobleſt families of

This ſallie beeing ended, the great ſquadron of the leaguers, came on the forefront of the kings, where they ſawe his Highneſſe before his company, fiue long paces off, who furiouſly ruſhed among the leaguers, which could not by any meanes with all their huge forreſt of launciers, keepe backe the kings ſquadron. But his Maieſtie did in ſuch warre like ſorts aſſayle them, that this great ſquadron was at laſt ſcattered, hauing beene fighting among the thickeſt of them, a good quarter of an houre. In the end, this huge heape of enemies, who had thus the foundation of their ſtrength abated, were at laſt brought to hand-ſtrokes, who beginning to ſhrinke, in the turning of a hand men might ſee their backes, which before ſhewed ſuch furious faces, who tooke their flight by ſtraunge paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
               <p>This ioyfull victorie was at firſt intermixt with much ſorrow in the royall armie, when they ſaw not the king returne: but within a while after, they ſpied him comming, all ſtained with the blood of his enemies, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſhed one drop of his owne, whom they deſcribed onely by the great plume of white feathers which hee bore in his creaſt, and that which his Palfraye had on his head.

               <p>But as hee came from the chaſe of his enemies, with twelue or fifteen of his followers, hee chancſt to meete betwixt two companies of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Switzers, three cornets of Wallons, accompanied with other that had ioyned with them, whom his Maieſtie charged with ſuch high courager that hee wonne their colours, they which carried them lying dead in the place, with many other of their companions.

               <p>His Maieſtie hauing ſet in order certaine of his troupes, and ſeeing his enemies flying before him, hee left the field ſurcharged with their dead: ſo that there remained none aliue, ſauing the Switzers, who beeing forſaken by their horſemen, did notwithſtanding ſtay without mouing: and althogh the king might well haue ouerrun them, yet hee receiued them to mercie: who hauing caſt down their weapons, were diſcharged and ſent into their own countries.

               <p>This beeing done, the king accompanied with his horſemen and the troups of <hi>Picardie,</hi> followed the league, which tooke their flight two waies.

The king was counſelled to paſſe the riuer at the ſord of <hi>Anet,</hi> and although it were an houre and an halfe loſſe of his way, yet hee ouertooke a great number of thoſe that fledde, which for their liues reſted at his diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Thoſe that thought to eſcape, putting themſelues into the woods, fell into the Peſants hands, which handled them in cruell ſort. This purſuit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued euen to the Towne of <hi>Mant,</hi> where neither the Duke <hi>de Maine,</hi> nor any of his, turned once their face to ſee who purſued them.

But beeing in the end ouercome by the D. <hi>de Maines</hi> earneſt intreaties, they gaue them leaue to enter the Towne, vpon condition that thoſe of his ſide, ſhould paſſe by tenne and tenne in the night beyond the bridge, which indeed wrought their ſafetie. The king ſeeing his enemies ouercome both with ſhame and loſſe, reſted himſelf neare vnto <hi>Mant,</hi> the which ſoone after the Leaguers were departed thence, yeelded themſelues to the king, as alſo the Towne of

               <p>Of the horſemen there were about fifteen hundreth ſlaine and drowned: and about foure hundreth taken priſoners. Among the dead there was knowne to be ſlaine, the Earle of <hi>Egmont,</hi> who was Colonell of the troupes ſent by the Duke of <hi>Parma:</hi> one of the Dukes of

               <p>The people beeing not ſatified with ſuch falſe quoyne, and hearing eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day more then other, contrarie reports, by certaine men that had eſcaped from the ſaid bloodie fight on the leaguers ſide, murmured greatly thereat, as people that deſired peace.

               <p>The Parliament of <hi>Roane,</hi> that according to their olde cuſtome, did bend themſelues againſt their king and gracious ſoueraigne, did execute and put to death the ſeuenth of Aprill, certaine priſoners which were ſeruants to the king.

And whileſt the leaguers applyed theſe buſineſſes, the king hoping by gentleneſſe to win the Pariſians to obedience, continued ſtil at <hi>Mant,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further hot following his victorie. But the trumpets of ſedition im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting this mildneſſe to the kings want of courage, perſwaded with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that he whom they called their ſworn and irreconcileably enemie, ſhuld be ſhortly brought to ſuch a hard exegent, that he would bee glad either to graunt them their owne requeſt, or elſe that they ſhould ſee him vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.

The Pariſians had ſuch confidence in the promiſes of the leaguers, that they aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves, the king was not able to hold out many weekes againſt their forces, inſomuch that they reſpected not the ſtrengthening of their Cittie, to repell the batterie of any foe, or the ſtrength of any ſiege. In time of peace, that great and goodly Cittie was daily maintained and ſerued with freſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion, as well one weeke as an other, by the infinite commodities that was brought thervnto both far and neare, by the help of the riuers of <hi>Seine, Marne,</hi> and <hi>Oiſe.</hi> Diuers particular perſons, wiſely foreſeeing a ſtorme, made prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before hand for their families.</p>
               <p>But the number of the Inhabitants in that little world was ſo mightie great, <pb n="241" facs="tcp:22081:280"/>that for one prudent houſekeeper, there was found an hundreth that neuer thought to prouide againſt the time to come, or ſought to ſhun a miſchiefe before it fell vppon their pates: whereof followed the ſtrange and wofull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations, which I will briefly preſent heere vnto you.</p>
               <p>The fiue and twentieth day of Aprill, the king returning toward

In the beginning of this ſiege, the affaires were horribly toſſed.

Theſe Preachers beeing poyſoned with Spaniſh golde, and maintained by the chiefe Ladies of the league, did ſo inuenome the people with ſubtill perſwaſions againſt their lawfull king and ſoueraigne Lord, that they reſolued to periſh miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in the ſiege: propounding on the other ſide, queſtions to the facultie of <hi>Sorbonne:</hi> that is to ſay, if it come ſo to paſſe, that the Cardinall of <hi>Bourbon</hi> ſhould die being priſoner, whom they called king <hi>Charles</hi> the tenth: whether then they might receiue <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bourbon</hi> for their king, or no: though hee would reconcile himſelfe to the Pope.</p>
               <p>Alſo whether they that ſhould ſeeke to make peace with the ſaid <hi>Henry,</hi> or that permitted the ſame, might not giue cauſe to bee held and ſuſpected, or counted a fauourer of hereſies, if it were according to the law of God, if they might faile therein, without mortall ſinne and paine of damnation.

The ſeuenth of May, in the third generall Congregation, made for the deciſsion of theſe articles in the great hal of the Colledge of <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi> all the Doctors of that facultie in generall, and each one in particular, which were by oath called to this Councell, concluded and reſolued with one accord, vpon this that followeth.</p>
               <p>It is by the right of Eccleſiaſticall lawes, forbidden and prohibited, that Catholicques ſhould receiue an hereticque for their king, or a fauourer of hereſie, and a notorious enemie of the Church: and more ſtraightly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to receiue one that was fallen away, and excommunicated from the holy mother Church.

<hi>Montpenſier,</hi> and others, ſolicited the people on their ſide, with ſtrong perſwaſions, rather to periſh by the famine, then to ſpeake or ſeek for agreement with the king.

               <p>But the kings minde or intent was not to poſſeſſe
<hi>Parris</hi> in ſuch ſort as his enemies imagined. For although the ſame were in a manner vnpoſsible, by reaſon of the ſmal number of his people, yet would he not ſee and behold, much leſſe procure the ruine of his chiefe and capitall Cittie: although that many therein, eſpecially the chiefeſt, deſerued for their offences moſt gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous puniſhment.

               <p>But the miſerie of the Pariſians was ſo great, that ſome of them were inforeſt to yeelde, the other would rather indure an hundreth deathes by famine. <pb n="244" facs="tcp:22081:282"/>So that within twelue or fifteene weekes, there was an extreame deſolation among them. They eate vp both their mooueables and their mony. The ſouldiers had licenſe to bee ſo bold, that they broke vp their walles, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed the chaſtitie of many families. The principal men of the League roſe vp, and tooke to themſelues the relicques of their Churches. The anucient Iuels and the Crownes of the kings of
<hi>France,</hi> were put in the font. Thoſe houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders which were rich, were ſubtilly ſpoyled, the ſubburbes ruined, the Cittie become full of ſorrow and need: the rents of the chamber of the Cittie lay dead: the lands all about vntilled and deſolate. An hundreth thouſand perſons died with hunger, with nakedneſſe, with pouertie, in the ſtreetes, and in the Hoſpitals, without all mercie or reliefe, in the ſpace of three moneths.</p>
               <p>The Vniuerſitie was conuerted to a deſart place, wherevnto all the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants reſorted for lodging, and the Cloiſters of the Colledges were conuerted into ſtables for beaſts. VVithin the great hall of the Pallace, there was none found but Leaguers and forgers of newes. In the ſtreetes graſſe did growe plenteouſly, and the ſhoppes for the moſt part were ſhut in continually. In ſtead of Chariots and Coches, appeared on the one ſide certaine troupes of men of warre, who were more imployed to fight with hunger, then with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other enemie: on the other ſide, an horrible deſolation.

               </p>
               <p>The moſt part of the furie of this famine, fell vpon the third eſtate: as for the Cleargie, who for the moſt part were well prouided, they preached no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but patience. And the Prelates before mentioned, vttered ſtill vilde things againſt the king and his followers, and in all their ſermons aſſured the poore famiſhed people, that the Spaniſh ſuccours would come very ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. On the one ſide, thoſe whom they called the ſixteene: on the other, the, fortie, with the factious ſort that wore long gownes, wrought in the wheel.</p>
               <p>The Parliament, which continued as it were ſlaues, both to the Spaniard &amp; to the <hi>Guiſe,</hi> publiſhed an Edict the fifteenth day of Iune, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was prohibited vnto all, of what eſtate, quallitie, dignitie, and condition ſo euer they were, not to ſpeake of any compoſition with <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> on paine of death, but thereby were inioyned to oppoſe themſelues againſt him, by all the meanes they might, and not to ſpare any practiſe whatſoeuer: ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Moreouer this court ordained, that all the Inhabitants of the Towne ſhould bee obedient to the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> Gouernour of the Ile of <hi>France,</hi> in all things which they ſhould bee commaunded to do on his behalfe, and that this Edict ſhould bee read and publiſhed throughout all the ſtreets and lanes of <hi>Parris,</hi> to the end, that more ſhould pretend cauſe of ignorance.</p>
               <p>But the people, who could not liue by paper, nor the windie promiſes of the Duke <hi>de Maine</hi> and his Preachers, after they had eaten dogges and cats, horſes, aſſes, mules, hearbes, rootes, and all that they could imagine to get in their neceſsitie, came in a ſhole to the Pallace, requiring peace of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell there aſſembled, where they made among them a certaine tumult: but the Captaines who were before aduertiſed of their comming, at laſt appeaſed <pb n="245" facs="tcp:22081:282"/>

               <p>The <hi>Cheualier d'Aumalle</hi> beeing followed by his adherents, went among the multitude, cauſing all the gates of the Pallace to bee ſhut, and impriſoned a great number of them, of whome there were ſome afterward hanged. The chiefe of the leaguers perceiuing that in the end, the diſcontented multitude would worke their confuſion, if in time they did not preuent them:<note place="margin">The chiefe of the league ſeeketh to de ceiue both the king and the people.</note> aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themſelues togither with the principall of their Towne, and after many writings, notwithſtanding the diuiſion of the <hi>Sorbonniſts,</hi> and the act made in the Leaguers Parliament, were reſolued that the Biſhoppe of <hi>Parris,</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Lyon,</hi> ſhould go to ſeeke out the king, to conferre vpon means of pacification. This was done in the beginning of Auguſt: but before they departed, they would haue leaue of the Legate, to the end they might not be excommunicated by the Pope. Before they had obtained it, the Legat made a conſultation with <hi>Panigarde, Bellermin,</hi> and <hi>Terius,</hi> Rector to the Ieſuites, compriſed in theſe articles: that is to ſay: If the Pariſians did runne into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, being conſtrained by famine to yeelde themſelues to an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall Prince.

The moſt wicked and horrible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyaltie of the chiefe of the league, diſcouering the vanitities of their badde purpoſe: hee drew his diſcourſe into diuers articles to the Biſhoppe of <hi>Parris,</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> who in their excuſes, accuſed themſelues more and <pb n="245" facs="tcp:22081:283"/>more, before a moſt noble companie of Princes, Lords, and Gentlemen of <hi>France,</hi> who were attending round about the King. Moreouer hee ſhewed that the report of the Spaniſh ſuccoors for <hi>Parris,</hi> made him nothing diſmaid: and cauſed them clearely to ſee wherevnto the Spaniſh forces tended: and that it was not for nothing that the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> tooke his way into

<hi>Parris</hi> and the kingdome beeing morſels too big for king

<hi>Sancerre</hi> were reſolued to indure the extremities of their ſiege, becauſe their enemies would haue depriued them without mercie, both of their goods, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, religion, and their liues. But contrariwiſe (ſaid hee) I will ſurrender to the Pariſians, the life which <hi>Mendoza</hi> the Spaniſh Ambaſſador doth at this preſent take from them, by their ſore famine. As for the religion, all theſe Princes and Catholicque Lords ſhall witneſſe vnto you, how I vſe it: nor wil I conſtraine them againſt their conſcience, were it neuer ſo litle, either in the exerciſe of religion, or otherwiſe. Concerning goods and liberties, I giue them to my ſubiects. So that the compariſon with thoſe of <hi>Gaunt</hi> is not good. The Pariſians haue well ſhewen what hearts they haue, hauing ſuffered me to poſſeſſe their ſubburbs. I haue fiue thouſand Gentlemen, that neuer feared thoſe of <hi>Gaunt,</hi>

               <p>After certaine other diſcourſes, witneſsing the kings good conſcience, and the litle feare he had of the leaguers forces, the Deputies tooke their way toward the Duke <hi>de Maine,</hi> who ſent them backe againe to his Maieſtie, with declaration, that he deſired nothing more then peace. At the ſame time hee ſent letters to thoſe of <hi>Parris,</hi> by one of his owne Secretaries, euen at the ſaid Deputies heeles, aduertiſing his partakers, not to bee diſcouraged for all the anſwere which he ſent to the king: and that hee would ſooner die then make peace with him.

               <p>As for the king, hee indured both before and after that which the Pariſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans vttered out of their rebellious mouthes, that they had brought victuals for the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> and others, which made them render him euill for good, nor made hee any ſtrong warre againſt his chiefe Cittie, hauing an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to preſerue it if he could.</p>

And the eight of the ſame moneth by breake of day, the moſt of their footemen paſſed away by the ſame, cauſing nine peeces of Ordenance to bee ſhot off: the riuer beeing betweene them, the breach was made before the king could haue knowledge thereof, by reaſon that the winde was turned <pb n="248" facs="tcp:22081:284"/>contrarie, and the bluſtering ſo great, that the ſound of the cannons could not bee heard in the royall armie.</p>
               <p>After the taking of this, the Dukes of <hi>Parma</hi> and of
<hi>Maine,</hi> ſeeing the weakneſſe of the place, did diſmantle it. And although the king to draw them vnto fight, fained as though hee would aſſaile <hi>Parris,</hi> and publiſhed a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſcale it, beeing departed from them in the euening the tenth of this moneth, with a good troupe: notwithſtanding they would not ſtirre out of the Marſh. VVherfore the king by aduiſe of his Councell diſmiſſed his armie, and fortified the Townes which hee held about <hi>Paris,</hi> chiefly thoſe on the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of
<hi>Seine,</hi> ſending a part of his troups into <hi>Touraine, Normandie, Champagne,</hi> and <hi>Bourgongne,</hi> and kept notwithſtanding a ſufficient armie to amaze his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>Some haue boldly written, that the king was then very ill counſelled, and in fauour of the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> who in fewe daies had beene inforeſt to fight, or to haue fled: that it was not poſsible for ſo great an armie as hee had, to continue long in a Marſh, where they ſhould indure much harme. That <hi>Parris</hi> and the league were now in ſafetie. That the fault came through part of the Nobilitie, induced therevnto by certaine enemies to the religion and the kings proſperities, who was forſaken at his need. Other ſome alſo being accuſtomed to fiſh in troubled waters, would not it ſhould bee yet cleared: and others pretended to ſerue the king as it ſeemed beſt vnto them, &amp; alwaies to ſee one confuſion riſe of another.
<note place="margin">The Duke of Parma commeth to Paris and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Corbeil.</note>By meanes of which proceedings, the Dukes were incouraged to go out of the Marſhes, to enter triumphantly into <hi>Paris,</hi> whereof the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> named himſelfe the deliuerer. And to make his valour appeare the greater, hee departed incontinent to beſiege <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beil,</hi> about halfe a daies iourney from thence, vpon the riuer of <hi>Seine.</hi> Captain <hi>Rigaud,</hi> commaunding ouer certaine companies of footemen, behaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo valiantly, that he ſlew a great number of the leaguers. As for the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> after the heating of his troupes, of whom many were ſlaine: he loſt much of his reputation. For it was there wher his armie was ſo weakned, and during the time hee reſted in that place, the king got togither his troupes, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſsing them to new purpoſes, which brought the league into greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances then before.</p>
               <p>The king of <hi>Spaines</hi> Agents thought to fill his good Cittie of <hi>Paris</hi> (ſo the Spaniard called it in his letters) with Spaniſh companies and VVallons. But on the one ſide, they had nothing to eate: and on the other, ſo ſoone as thoſe of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and other Captaines of the league (moreouer the ſixteen and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of
<hi>Paris</hi>) ſawe themſelues ſomewhat at large, they began to giue the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> thankes for his good will, and intreated him to go with his people to <hi>Bruxelles</hi> againe. This requeſt or ſecret commaundement fell out verie well for the Duke: for on the one part, his armie in all mens ſight was ſeene daily to waſte, and himſelfe did plainely behold, that hee ſtood in the midſt of an vnconſtant multitude, and that it was not good for him to put confidence in faithleſſe peple. The leauing of his forces there, to glut <hi>Paris</hi> euen as <hi>Antwerp</hi> had bin, was to turne all vpſide downe, and build a new and perilous matter for the Spaniards: that the king watcht to giue them a ſhameful ouerthrow, if they ſhould ſeparate themſelues neuer ſo little.</p>
               <p>Therefore hee determined to get him gone with all ſpeed poſsible, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <pb n="249" facs="tcp:22081:284"/>conſumed a world of money, leauing the Leaguers Captaines more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with the gold of <hi>Peru,</hi> then euer they were before.<note place="margin">The Duke of Parma re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Bruxels, hauing done nothing, but growne unto ſhame and euill report with the Leaguers.</note> Of all his forces hee had great neede: for the king ceaſed not to runne vpon him, purſuing him to the verie frontiers of
<hi>Arroys,</hi> and diminiſhing his armie euery day more and more, to ſignifie vnto the Spaniards, that <hi>France</hi> could not bee ruinated or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken but through their owne follie.</p>
               <p>Now, aſſoone as they were thus departed, <hi>Corbeil</hi> and other ſmall townes which they had taken, were againe recouered by the kings troupes: the which brought the Pariſians into new confuſions.

               <p>In diuers parts of the kingdome, as in <hi>Brittaine, Prouence,</hi> and <hi>Languedoc,</hi> the League ſtirred and did many outragious and wicked acts, working deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the great preiudice of the kings ſubiects: but it little aduantaged the Leaguers, whoſe armies conſiſted of ſuch people, that ſought no other thing but diſorders. Alſo they could neither grow nor continue, but by the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of others, which they raiſed by their forces &amp; bad purpoſes, for whereas they fained that they wold haue the Spaniard to ioyne with them, it was for no other thing, but to draw into their hands his double Piſtollets: in lieu whereof, they would preſent him a new nothing betwixt two diſhes. And if hee ſhewed himſelfe diſcontent, they would helpe to throwe him out of thoſe places which hee had vſurped, as it came to paſſe ſoone after.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1591"/> In the beginning of this year, the king continued his incloſing of the Pariſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which were fallen into their wonted diſtreſſes as before.

Haue ordained, and by theſe preſents do ordaine, that if any haue been excommunicated by vertue of the aforeſaid proceedings, they are abſolued thereof: and that the ſaid bulles, and all the proceedings made by vertue of them, ſhall bee burned in the Market-place of this Cittie, by the hands of the executioner.</p>
               <p>Againe it is ordained, that the ſaid <hi>Landriano</hi> the Popes pretended <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> entering priuily into this Realme without the kings leaue or licence, ſhal bee perſonally taken and conueyed to the kings priſon in this Cittie of <hi>Chaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons,</hi> there to aunſwere to all ſuch things as ſhall bee alleadged againſt him. And if his taking and apprehention cannot preſently bee, there ſhall be three daies libertie giuen for the ſame, according to the accuſtomed manner. And to him that ſhall deliuer him vp to the lawe, ſhall bee giuen tenne thouſand pound.</p>
               <p>Straightly charging and forbidding all perſon &amp; perſons, of what eſtate, qualitie, or condition ſoeuer they bee, to keepe, receiue, ſuccour, or harbour the ſaide pretended <hi>Nuntio</hi> on paine of death: And all Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoppes, Biſhoppes, and all other Eccleſiaſticall perſons, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, <pb n="254" facs="tcp:22081:287"/>nor publiſh, nor ſuffer to be publiſhed, any ſentences or proceedings, comming in the behalfe of the foreſaid <hi>Nuntio,</hi> vppon paine to bee puniſhed as in caſe of high treaſon.</p>
               <p>Alſo it is declared, and we do declare, the Cardinals beeing at <hi>Rome,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, and all all other Eccleſiaſticall perſons, that haue counſelled and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſaid bull and excommunication, and that haue allowed that moſt inhumane, moſt abhominable, &amp; moſt deteſtable parriſide, traiterouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on the perſon of the foreſaid deceaſed Lord <hi>Henry</hi> the third, the moſt Chriſtian and the moſt Catholicque king of <hi>France,</hi> worthily caſt off from the poceſsion of thoſe benefices held by them within this Realme: Inioyning the Atturney generall to ſeize them into the kings hands, and there to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh good and ſufficient Commiſsioners, forbidding all other his ſubiects to carrie or ſend gold or ſiluer to <hi>Rome,</hi> or to ſue to the Pope for the obtaining of benifices, vntill it ſhall bee otherwiſe ordered by the king.</p>
               <p>And the act of appeale ſhall be by the Atturney generall, deferred vntil the next Councell, lawfully aſſembled by Pope
<hi>Gregorie</hi> the fourteenth, &amp;c. The Parliament at <hi>Tours</hi> proclaimed the ſame decree, adding moreouer in theirs, theſe words: VVee haue proclaimed and do proclaime, Pope <hi>Gregor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> the 14. of that name, an enemie to the common peace, to the vnion of the Romain Catholicke Church, to the King and to his royall eſtate, adherent to the conſpiracie of <hi>Spaine,</hi> a fauourer of rebels, guiltie of the moſt cruell, moſt inhumane, and moſt deteſtable Parriſide, traiterouſly committed on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, of moſt famous, moſt Chriſtian, and moſt Catholicque memorie.</p>
               <p>Certaine months after, and about the end of the yeare the parliament of the League at <hi>Paris,</hi> condemned and cauſed all thoſe decrees to be burned, which were giuen out againſt the Popes bulles, and the Miniſters of that ſea. As for <hi>Landriano</hi> and the Legat, they were kept cloſe and ſecret. Finally after they had beene well feed, they got ſafely out of <hi>France,</hi> through the kings mercifull fauour, carrying away great booties, whereof they had ſmall ioy, becauſe that ſoone after their returne they died.</p>
               <p>The moſt part of the priſoners of <hi>Blois,</hi> who then with the Duke and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> ſhould haue beene done to death, eſcaped away, ſome after one ſort and ſome after another. But one of their principalll men remained ſtil vnder ſure gard in the Caſtle of <hi>Tours:</hi> that is to ſay, the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> whom the multitude of the Leaguers, and diuers Pariſians did greatly deſire, ſaying many times, that if after the death of his father, and before the comming of his vncle <hi>de Maine,</hi> hee had beene within <hi>Paris,</hi> that of a certaine they had carried him to <hi>Reimes,</hi> ſacred and crowned king of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But his keepers held him ſure ynough from them, for the kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours would not, that the ſeditious ſhould haue ſo fit a ſubiect to worke vppon, nor ſuch ſtore of wood and oyle to increaſe the flames of their ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the Duke <hi>de Maine</hi> hauing obtained his new title, to bee Lieftenant generall of the eſtate and Crown of
<hi>France,</hi> deſired not that his Nephewe ſhould bee at more libertie. Neither was the royall throne and ſeat bigge ynough for two to ſit in, and hee which was alreadie ſetled, <pb n="255" facs="tcp:22081:287"/>would not come downe, to ſuffer a younger then himſelfe to aſcend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into.</p>
               <p>Diuers other of the principall men of the League, willing to counterchecke the Duke <hi>de Maine,</hi> did all that poſsibly they could, to preferre his young Nephew: but all in vaine. When the Kings Councell ſaw fit time to thwart the Dukes of <hi>Maine</hi> and <hi>Nemours,</hi> which by diuers ſlights did daily robbe the Crowne, as alſo diuers other ſtraungers did, would notwithſtanding ſet on them againe, and ſeeke to deſtroy the one by the other: they cauſed their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faiers to bee ſo diſpoſed for the keeping of this perſon, that the Duke of
<hi>Guiſe,</hi> eſcaped the fifteenth day of Auguſt, by a cord which was giuen him,<note place="margin">The Duke of Guiſe eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth out of priſon.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſliding down out of one of the windowes, hee went quite away. There was but ſmall running after him, who hauing found all things readie for his conueyance, tooke his way to the Lord <hi>de la Chaſtre,</hi> who kept him in a ſure place.</p>
               <p>Thoſe which iudged not but ſuperficially of theſe things, namely the Leaguers, made bonfires for ioye of this eſcape, ſuppoſing that this young Prince ſhould be ſo well prouided for, that he ſhould bee made king for the holy vnion. But the Lieftenant generall his vncle, and certaine others, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to beare away the beſt part in that peece, were of an other minde.
<note place="margin">Noyon beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the king.</note>The King all this while ſlept not, hauing the ſelfe ſame moneth beſieged <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yon,</hi> a towne in <hi>Picardie</hi> held by the league, and hauing ouerthrown by foure aſſaults, the ſuccours which the League had ſent them, ſlaine the moſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute men of war on their ſide, taken a great number of priſoners, put the reſt to flight, and conſtrained the beſieged to yeelde.</p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>de Maine</hi> with the Lords of <hi>Belin, Vitri, d'Alincourt</hi> and others, had a great minde to ſet vppon <hi>Mante,</hi> thinking to withdraw the king, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward aſſayed to force the Switzers of <hi>Soleurre</hi> lodged at <hi>Houdan,</hi> but all in vaine, as alſo was their comming to <hi>Noyon.</hi> For the king beeing neuer moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with their bragges, followed to the poynt of his purpoſe, euen to the verie noſes of his enemies, who daring not to come vnder his hands, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Maiſter of the Towne. And hauing brought vppon the Leaguers and Spaniards great ſhame and diſhonour, hee chaſed them euen vnto <hi>Han,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoking and inforcing them to fight, but they could not heare on that ſide.
<hi>Noyon</hi> was yeelded and giuen vp to the King the ſeuenteenth of Auguſt. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a month after,<note place="margin">The Duke of Sauois armie ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne at Pontcharra.</note> the Lord of <hi>Diquieres</hi> was ouerthrowne in the plaine of <hi>Pontcharra,</hi> neare vnto the Caſtle of

               <p>There were ſlaine vppon that plaine, more then two thouſand and fiue hundreth of the Dukes armie, a great number were taken priſoners, beeing for the moſt part Gentlemen of commaund. They wonne alſo aboue three hundreth horſe, eighteene colours bearing the redde croſſe, a Cornet was there taken, and all their baggage left behinde.</p>
               <p>The bootie which was gotten, amounted to the ſumme of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth thouſand Crownes, the moſt part thereof beeing in chaines, rings, ſiluer cuppes, and coyne both of golde and ſiluer, the reſt in horſes and armour.</p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:22081:288"/>
               <p>The next day, two thouſand Romaines and ſouldiers of
<hi>Milaine,</hi> who with their commander the Earle <hi>Galeotte</hi> of
<hi>Belioyeuſe,</hi> were ſaued within the Caſtle <hi>d'Aualon,</hi> at length yeelded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to the kings mercie. But the furie of the ſoldiers could not be quieted, til they had ſlain ſix or ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hundreth of them, the reſt hauing white wands giuen in ſtead of Paſports, were ſent into <hi>Italie,</hi> there to make report of their vnhappie fortune, hauing promiſed neuer to beare armes againſt <hi>France</hi> any more.</p>
               <p>This victorie was the more excellent, for that on the kings ſide, after they had ſearched their companies, there was found but one horſeman, and two footemen dead, and three or foure hurt. The reſt of this yeare was ſpent by the Lord of <hi>Diguieres,</hi> in the fortifying of
<hi>Grenoble,</hi> and in the refreſhing of his garriſons. After the taking of <hi>Noyon,</hi> the king cauſed a part of his troupes to go into
<hi>Normandie,</hi> as well to ſame thoſe of <hi>Roane,</hi> who ſhewed themſelues no leſſe obſtinate then the Pariſians, as alſo to prouoke the Spaniards vnto bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, for he knew that incontinuent the leaguers would crie for ayde: and that if the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> deferred their ſuccour, that he ſhould either ſoon ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw them, or quickly bring them to ſome reaſon. On the contrarie, if the Duke ſhould come there, it would be a meanes to diſpatch their affaires, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that God would fauour his iuſt cauſe, againſt the vngodly and infamous rebellion of his enemies. In the meane ſpace, hee gaue order that <hi>Paris</hi> ſhould be incloſed on euery ſide, keeping ſtill his garriſons in the fort of
<hi>Gournay</hi> vpon <hi>Marne,</hi> at Saint <hi>Dennis, Melun, Corbeil,</hi> and other places, as well by water as by land, the great tributes and taxes which was gathered for the bringing of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall to the Pariſians, and the maintenance of their troupes, did ſo glean their mony from them, peece by peece, that it brought the people to great pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
               <p>The Leaguers then did that which was loooked for: for after the king<note place="margin">The ſecond and the laſt comming of the Duke of Parma into France.</note> had ſet forward to <hi>Normandie,</hi> the king of
<hi>Spaine</hi> beeing ſolicited from diuers parts, and of his owne accord alſo, for the recouering of his money, ſent the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> who was diligently prouiding for the affaires of the lowe countries, into
<hi>Normandie,</hi> to relieue thoſe of <hi>Roane,</hi> and to helpe them, vpon ſuch occaſions as ſhould bee preſented. Thoſe of
<hi>Guiſe</hi> and other comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the league, made continuall ſute to the ſaide Duke to that effect. By this meanes toward the end of the yeare, the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> hauing commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the gouernment of the low Countries to the Earle of <hi>Mansfield,</hi> departed from <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> and with foure thouſand foote, and three thouſand horſe, ſet forward on his way, making ſmall iournies, becauſe hee thought it the moſt neceſſarie for him, and that vnder the appearance of armes, hee might attaine to an higher purpoſe: which was, to procure the ſtates of the league to giue the Crowne of <hi>France</hi> to the king of <hi>Spaines</hi> daughter, whom they had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to wife vnto one of the chief of that partie. The Dukes armie was ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened by the Italian ſuccours, conducted by <hi>Sfondrate</hi> Earle of <hi>Montemarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and three thouſand Switzers.</p>
               <p>While all this preparation was made, the ſixteene of

In this ſort periſhed theſe learned men, eſpecially <hi>Briſſon,</hi> which plunged himſelfe againſt his conſcience, into this pit of execrable felonie, againſt his ſoueraigne Lord, and the lawes of the Realme.

And to giue ſome colour to the ſame, they haue publiſhed a certain writing in forme of a bull, giuing power and authoritie to the Cardinall of <hi>Plaiſance,</hi> to aſsiſt and authorize the ſaid pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended election, wherein the rebellious and ſeditious ſort diſcouered open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that which till then they had kept cloſe.

This is a thing that all good Catholicque Frenchmen ought to deteſt and abhorre, as a matter directly contrary to the word of God, holy decrees, Councels, and liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> or French Church: the which openeth a gappe to all ruine and ſubuerſion of all humane ſocieties and pollicies, inſtituted of God, namely in this renowmed and flouriſhing Monarchie, the ouerthrow of the ground of the law, wherein principally conſiſteth the true order of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſucceſsion of our kings.

               <p>The leaguers deſpiſing the kings authoritie, flowted at the Edict of this Parliament: and called the Deputies from all parts of the Prouinces and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate Townes, to bee preſent with the eſtates at

<note place="margin">The death of the Duke of Parma.</note>But death cut off the thrid of his life, togither with his enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the ſecond of December, 1592. Many men thought that this blowe would rent thoſe patches wherewith the league was attired.</p>
               <p>But the Duke <hi>de Maine</hi> beeing deliuered of him of whom hee ſtood in doubt, ſuppoſed that now the time preſented it ſelfe, wherein hee might bring his long deſired purpoſe to effect, heerevpon hee raiſed his Cornets of horſe, and did more miſchiefe to <hi>Paris</hi> then before.</p>

               <p>A little before theſe newes came, hee gaue ſome eare to the conditions of peace, which had beene happie for him, if ſome euill counſell had not turned his mind from the ſame. But the deceaſe of him by whom he was ouer awed, cauſed his humour to bee changed, imagining that hee ſhould ſhortly haue the title, to bee Lieftenant generall to the King of

               <p>The Pariſians, which before ſpake openly of peace and agreement, durſt now ſpeake no more thereof, except in ſecret. In the feaſt of Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, the Duke <hi>de Maine</hi> cauſed thoſe decrees which were lately made at <hi>Chaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons</hi> againſt the bull of the Popes Legat, to bee openly burned vpon the ſteps of his Pallace, the Citie beeing all in armes. Alſo the Dukes of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> of <hi>Maine,</hi> of

During theſe practiſes, the king was fully reſolued to aſſemble the principall Peeres of his Realme at <hi>Chartres,</hi> to prouide and thinke vpon remedies againſt thoſe euils, which now beganne to preſent it ſelfe.

               <p>And for as much that ſuch a voyce was ſpredde abroad, by the notable aduertiſements of other Councellours, Ciuill and Eccleſiaſticall, it ſeemed to them, that the king would incline therevnto, and the Deputies of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Lords of his Councell, communicating with thoſe of the League, to preuent the election of a new king, gaue ſome hope thereof.

               </p>
               <p>During this generall truce, many matters were intended for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the affaires of the kingdome. The king, which deſired the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſubiects, and the aboliſhment of the pernicious league, aſſayed by faire meanes to winne the Duke <hi>de Maine,</hi> in making him offer of charge, and honourable aſſurances of preferment. The Duke, which ſeemed yet to haue two ſtrings to his bowe, bargained, promiſed, refuſed, aduanced, gathered, and ſtretched theſe matters to the length: procuring vnder hand, that the deciſion of the Sorbonniſts in the yeare 1590. might take place: that is to ſay, that <hi>Henry</hi> of
<hi>Bourbon</hi> was declared vnworthie of all right or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to the Crowne, although hee made profeſsion of the Romaine religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Spaniſh Agents in <hi>France</hi> ſet this matter forward, working with all their power, for the preferment of the Duke of <hi>Neuers.</hi> On the other ſide, they induced both great and ſmall to continue their accuſtomed requeſt, for the aboliſhing of one of the religions in <hi>France:</hi> many other were of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the king could not be receiued, except hee firſt promiſed expreſly to driue away all thoſe of the reformed religion, or at leaſt to aboliſh and put <pb n="274" facs="tcp:22081:297"/>downe their publicque exerciſes. This counſell did hatch or breed infinit vniuſt matters in the reſt of the yeare, through diuers parts of <hi>France,</hi> where they of the religion could obtaine no true reſt, but in promiſe and papers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moleſted in effect with all reproaches that might bee imagined: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto they oppoſed themſelues in nothing but in peaceable complaints, and humble ſupplications. Notwithſtanding they obtained nothing, the deuices of their enemies beeing ſuch, that all their forepaſſed and faithfull ſeruices were diſdained, and contrariwiſe, the moſt part of the chiefe Captaines and leaguers Townes receiued into fauour, cheriſhed, and raiſed vnto honour. Briefly, all the kings good and faithfull ſeruants were caſt into the lake of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe, and the enemies and conſpirators of the eſtates ſet as it were in a chaire of triumph, before whom iuſtice was ſo ſhamefully abuſed, that the wronged cried vengeance from heauen, to fall vppon their deteſtable dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">There were alſo at this time other deuices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the king.</note>There was alſo at this time, an other ſort of Courtiers that greatly fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the League, and yet notwithſtanding fained to bee fauourers of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale and quiet of the Realme: who daily ſpredde rude reports of the kings inſufficiencie, ſaying that all meanes failed him, to make him be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that his enemies were of two great a number, and too mightie for him, yea inuincible: that they would ouerthrow him in ſhort time. That <hi>France</hi> vnder his raigne beeing ſcourged with ſo many warres, then falling into a new ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of deſolations and ſhamefull deceits, it could not but languiſh, and that it would come to paſſe, after once it hung the wing, that ſhe ſhould remaine a pray for a greater Maiſter. This was (by their account) the king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> of whom they made great bragges of his honour, reputation, and greatneſſe. His double Piſtolles had ſo bewitched their thoughts, that they alſo ſuppoſed to make the Frenchmen afraid with the very name of this Prince: remembring not at all, that an hundreth yeares before, <hi>Philip</hi> Artch-Duke of <hi>Auſtrige,</hi> great Grandfather to the king of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> made homage within the towne of <hi>Arras,</hi> to king
<hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, in the perſon of his Chancellor, the Earles of
<hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Artois,</hi> and <hi>Charrolois,</hi> where on his bended knees, hee called him his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Lord, ſwearing to become true ſeruant vnto the ſaid king <hi>Lewis,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to bee faithfull all daies of his life, and in his behalfe to ſtand againſt al other, to procure his welfare, to preuent his harmes, and in all things to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue himſelf toward him, as to his ſoueraigne Lord and Maiſter, of which the Hiſtories of theſe times do make true mention.</p>
               <p>While yet this truce indured, the king deliberated to aſſemble at <hi>Mante,</hi> certaine of the chiefe Nobles of the Realme, to take counſell on diuers mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at that time needfull. The Deputies of the reformed Churches were there preſent about the end of Nouember, whom the king cauſed to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led togither, the twelfth day of the moneth following, and hauing giuen them audience, and heard the great ſorrow which they made vpon the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit contradictions of his decrees, and their complaints of the greeuous wrongs done vnto them through all his Prouinces: hee aunſwered, that the change of religion, had not any whit changed his affection from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that hee would redreſſe their greefes, and make peace and concord among his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. He receiued their billes of complaints to haue them peruſed. But theſe affaires were drawn to ſuch length, that the diſtance of many yeares hath bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <pb n="275" facs="tcp:22081:297"/>all. And the Captaines of the league hauing plunged the Realme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to new miſeries, thoſe of the religion almoſt in all parts of the kingdom, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued as greeuous vnder the croſſe as before.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The war of Piedmont.</note>As for the warres on the other ſide of the mountaines, their affaires fell out in this ſort: About the ende of the yeare one thouſand fiue hundreth nin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tietwo, the Lord of <hi>Diguieres,</hi> beeing entered into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> had taken there for the king, <hi>Briqueras, Cauours,</hi> and three or foure other little townes, hauing ouerthrowne the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> in diuers incounters, as hee did alſo in <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uence,</hi> and on the frontiers of

<hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Duke, who was not ignorant of the eſtate and affaires of <hi>France,</hi> aſſayed to couer and hide the ſhame he had gotten in ſo many iournies, as in the plaine of <hi>Pontcharra,</hi> at <hi>Eſpernon de Pallieres,</hi> and otherwiſe in ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters in

               <p>Thus did the Frenchmen looſe in ſmall time, that which they had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in <hi>Piedmont:</hi> whereof men do write in diuers ſorts.

               <p>The report of this declaration, and the preparations which the king made to chaſtiſe their ſtubborn opinions, amazed the very principall of the league, &amp; the moſt part of the rebellious townes and commons.

               <p>Moreouer, the Inhabitants of <hi>Meaux,</hi> exhorted the Pariſians by a pithie letter to follow their example.

The Neapolitans made ſhewe as if they would proffer fight, refuſing to agree, except it were by the conſent of the Duke of <hi>Feria,</hi> and <hi>Don Diego d'Euera</hi> their Generall.</p>
               <p>They accepted ſoone after without reſiſtance, whatſoeuer it pleaſed the king to offer them, as vnto their Captaines: to witte, that all of them ſhould enioy their armes, and ſo depart with bagge and baggage out of the Cittie, from thence to haue ſafe conduct out of the Realme, toward the borders of <hi>Picardie,</hi> after they had promiſed the king neuer to beare armes in <hi>France</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his ſeruice.</p>
               <p>Heere was a thing woorthie to bee noted, that foure thouſand men on horſe and foote, entering armed into this little world of
<hi>Parris,</hi> ſhould put the league to ſilence, keepe ſo well the order preſcribed vnto them, and be ſo obedient, that no ſouldier left his rancke, to commit any outrage or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
               <p>That no Burgeous or Inhabitant was indomaged, nor ſo much as wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in his reputation, perſon, or goods: that all the people mingled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues preſently with the men of war, and other that entered with the king, in ſuch familiaritie, as if they had alwaies dwelt togither, filling the ſtreetes with ioyful applaudes and maruellous reioycings, euen as if they had eſcaped the hands of the hangman, to beholde the face of their deare father, or beſt beloued friend.</p>
               <p>The Kings troupes entered the Cittie, about foure of the clocke in the morning, and within two houres the ſhoppes were all ſet open, the Citie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing ſo peaceable, as if there had neuer been any change. The moſt paine which the kings ſeruants had, was to keepe the people with faire intreaties, who required no other thing, then to bee medling againſt the Spaniardes, Neapolitans, and VVallons, who were in number nine hundreth men, or thereabout, to bee reuenged on them, calling to minde the great iniuries which they had receiued by their meanes in times paſt.</p>

               <p>All their Churches and Temples were filled ſoone after, with praiers and ſongs of thanſgiuing to God, according to the order and cuſtome of the ſame Cittie, which was newes moſt pleaſing and agreeable to the Inhabitants. As much was done in all other places of the kings obeyſance, and namely in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers parts out of <hi>France.</hi> In ſhort time after, <hi>Baſtille</hi> was yeelded, and hee which commanded there for the league, ſent away with his ſouldiers.

               <p>At the ſame time the king publiſhed a declaration, wherein all the ſhifts and deceits of the Captaines of the league were diſcouered, and his loue and great good will toward the Pariſians, to whom hee forgaue all matters paſt, reſtored all their cuſtomes and priuiledges, obtained new fauors, and ſhewed a moſt fatherly affection towarde them, which was moſt pleaſing to the people, which drew many other townes from the league, to humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to his highneſſe.</p>

Now let vs turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to <hi>Paris,</hi> where they beganne a new warre. The Ieſuites hauing in former times ſtood againſt ſundrie purpoſes of the Vniuerſitie (whom they had ſet out in their colours, ſhewing that this ſect is the moſt execreable of al others) by the helpe of ſuch which had to do with thoſe people, for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of their great and moſt vnfortunate enterpriſes.

               <p>Theſe conſiderations were cauſe that the firſt reſolution taken by the Vniuerſitie of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſince the Citties reduction, was to require the baniſhing of the Ieſuites. To this effect a ſupplication was preſented to the Court of Parliament, who hauing a certaine time deſpiſed the authoritie thereof, in the end conſtrained by an act made the ſeuenth of Iuly, containing that the indightment which was to be giuen againſt them, ſhould be heard the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day following, in a publicque audience to be iudged in open field, they did that day entertaine their Aduocates and men of law in the great chamber be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the audience were readie, who did declare, that to defend the cauſe on their behalfe, he was conſtrained to ſay many hard things againſt diuers that

               <p>This deuice was made, to hinder the people from the cleare know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the corrupt and pernicious purpoſes of the Ieſuites, pretending to make all <hi>Europe</hi> ſubiect to the Spaniards: but for as much as they had obtained their requeſt, this inuention had no ſuch ſucceſſe as they looked for. For all their pleadings which were done cloſe within doores, was afterward openly publiſhed in print, where the Aduocates of the vniuerſitie, men learned and deepely affectioned to the Romaine Church, did particularly repreſent and diſcouer to the full, the horrible, wicked, and inſupportable malice of that ſect. But the deciding of the matter was ſuſpended: Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence reſeruing the ſame to an othertime, which came ſooner then many looked for.</p>
               <p>The Spaniards being deſirous to continue the fire of diſcention in <hi>France,</hi> inſtantly ſolicited the Duke <hi>de Mercoeur,</hi>

<hi>Varade,</hi> a notable Ieſuite, was more throughly marked, who had principally and more then any other, induced <hi>Barriere</hi> to kil the K. whom he called tyrant. It was alſo teſtified, that two Switzers paſsing by <hi>Beſancon,</hi> a fewe daies before <hi>Chastelles</hi> deede was attempted, did meet two men attired like Ieſuites, who ſaid one to the other, for ſhortly the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> ſhall bee either ſlaine or hurt: which deede they eſteemed moſt meritorious in the kingdome of heauen.</p>

In conſideration of theſe matters aforeſaid, and other prooues teſtified by the Hiſtorie of theſe times, the Ieſuites were baniſhed out of <hi>Paris</hi> and other townes of the Realme, but not out of all.

You know what belongs to your owne care, ſo do I of mine: for ſince it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to call me to the Crowne, I found <hi>France,</hi> not onely neare hand ruined, but almoſt vtterly loſt from the Frenchmen: I vowe, by Gods grace, by the prayers, by the good counſaile of my faithfull Subiects, that make profeſſion of Armes, by the ſword of my true Nobilitie (from which I do not diſtinguiſh my Princes) becauſe the faith of a Gentleman, is our fayreſt tytles: by my paines and labour I haue kept it from loſſe.

               <p>VVHat? Shall this Duke of <hi>Mercoeur</hi> for euer retaine the mouth of the Riuer of <hi>Loire,</hi> with one part of <hi>Britain</hi> againſt a king of <hi>France,</hi> a victorious king, acknowledged to be the greateſt Captaine in the world? Shall wee continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde this chanel, this ſincke, this puddle and heape of all the theeues and murtherers, firmly v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited with this inſolent, cruel, and infected nation of
<hi>Chaſtille,</hi> occupie one of the Prouinces of the eſtate, one of the flowers of this mightie and proude Crowne, and make their neighbours, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with all the higheſt part of this long riuer that diuideth the
<hi>Gaules,</hi> tributaries? All the reſt of <hi>France</hi> hath been almoſt theſe two yeares quiet, vnited and conioyned for her owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation, againſt al forraine vſurpation: yea, it is longer ſince our holy father powred foorth his bleſsings vpon this moſt Chriſtian kingdome. This Summer hath God ſent vs the moſt notable victorie and gallant triumph that hath beene ſeene this fiue hundreth yeares, where the King forced one of the ſtrongeſt peeces in the world, in the full view of the Spaniſh armie. All Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome is brought in admiration with ſuch a conqueſt, and the glorie of the French armies is now more glorious then euer it was: which notwithſtanding this Spartacus, relying vppon the imaginarie ſuccours of <hi>Spaine,</hi> dare tarie vs. Let vs therefore with all ſpeede make head againſt him: let vs abate this preſumption, this raſhneſſe, this inſolencie. Let vs go and ſet at libertie the poore Inhabitants of <hi>Nantes,</hi> who ſtretch foorth their hands to their king, and long onely for his comming: from whom this Viceroy of <hi>Brittaine</hi> ſhall hardly defend himſelfe within, whileſt we do couragiouſly aſſault him without. Let vs giue him to vnderſtand, that nothing is able to withstand the thunder of the French Arſenall, and that the braueſt Rauelines do ſtoupe to our cannons. Let vs roote out the Spaniard out of
<hi>Brittaine,</hi> which our ancesters neuer vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Crowne, for vs to diſmember it againe.</p>
               <p>Let vs conſider, that in all Martiall diſcourſes,
<hi>Amiens</hi> was not to bee wonne: yet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable vertue of our king: his great courage, &amp; the incredible trauels of the French, haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced nature: exceeded all hope: and ſurmounted all poſsibilitie: and contrariwiſe, that in all milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie reaſon, <hi>Nantes</hi> might be beaten flat in ſix weekes. The countrie forces, the ſtrength of the neighbour Prouinces, togither with all <hi>Guyenne,</hi> which beginne alreadie too march: the army royall that is on the way: the cannons and munition that commeth euery way: the benefit of the ſea and riuers able to furniſh all neceſſaries: the Nauall armies which repleniſhing all <hi>Loire,</hi> ſhall cut off all hope of ſuccour: the valour of our ſouldiers: the experience of our Captaines: and the aduantage of our laſt years happy conqueſt, may put vs in full aſſurance, that this <hi>Cateline,</hi> ſhall bee made an example of his Maiesties: who hath hitherto ſhewed ſuch testimonie of his clemencie. And in deede, in this man we may beholde ſuch ſtraunge ingratitude, that God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuffer it to paſſe vnpuniſhed.</p>
               <p>For the late king (whom God pardon) hauing ſo highly honoured his familie, as thereat to chooſe his wife, and heaped vp goods, honours, great titles, and extreame expenſes vpon his bretheren in lawe, and ſiſters in lawe: eſpecially vpon this modell of ingratitude, to whom hee procured one of the richeſt marriages in the Realme: for whoſe ſake hee wreſted the gouernment of <hi>Brittaine</hi> from a Prince of the blood, to giue him: yet hath hee become ſuch a notable traitor to his Benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that in lieu of ſpending his life at his feete, he hath procured a mightie and moſt important Prouince to reuolt from him: and ſtopped vp the mouth of the riuer of <hi>Loire,</hi> wherevppon the late king was forced to tranſport the ſeate of his enemies.</p>

               <p>Hee was the author of the rebellion of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> and immediately hath called the Caſtillians to ſhare in his conqueſts, whom hee hath ſetled in <hi>Blauet</hi> as a Spaniſh Colonie, to hold vs in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall checke, vntill we may haue rooted them out, togither with all thoſe that brought them in and cheriſhed them, and haue put themſelues in our protection &amp; ſafegard, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they ſhall finde to be but weake againſt the ſtrength of <hi>France,</hi> euen of the warlike

But ſo farre as I can perceiue, you haue but ſmall knowledge of the miſerable eſtate, whereinto your Protectors affaires in the lowe Countries are brought. This Summer hee hath loſt <hi>8.</hi> good peeces: an vndoubted argument of his weakneſſe. <hi>Artois</hi> is in a wonderfull amaze at this great exployt at <hi>Amiens.</hi> His garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are in ſuch neceſsitie, that either they muſt vtterly ranſome his ſubiects, or liue vpon rootes. The Cardinall hath not to defray the expences of his owne houſe. King
<hi>Philips</hi> banckroutſhip hath made him looſe his ſettings ouer from

               <p>VVell, this Summer we will make a iourney to viſit them: In the meane time, leauing our frontiers, able not onely to defend, but alſo to offend, let vs go ſtraight into <hi>Brittaine</hi> to puniſh the rebellion, ingratitude, and malice of him, who ſeeing <hi>Amiens</hi> ſurpriſed by the Spaniards, and all <hi>France</hi> in alarme, in lieu of concluding the truce which before hee demaunded, tooke the field, in purpoſe to detaine in the Prouinces a great number of ſouldiers, who before were taking horſe to come to his Maieſtie.</p>

Hitherto our ſlackneſſe hath had ſom reaſons: euery yeare hath had her neceſſarie imployments: but this yeare, a fatall yeare to <hi>Brittaine:</hi> hauing alreadie ſet hand to the enterpriſe, what a ſhame wil it be, not to finiſh it, or to ſuffer our ſelues to be ouercome with the only apprehenſion of the labor? VVhat glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry &amp; credit ſhal we ſo purchaſe to this Viceroy of <hi>Brittain?</hi> and what Spaniſh <hi>Rodomontades</hi> wil he make therof? Into what diſpaire ſhal we bring this Prouince, &amp; all her borderers, who for theſe two years, ſeeing others in peace, haue taſted the diſcommodities of wars? VVhat will our confederates ſay?

VVhat a dangerous example ſhall we ſet to thoſe that ſeeke to trouble the realme: if he that was neuer acounted a ſoldier: a man nurſed vp in the ſhadow &amp; in all riot: a man neuer aſſaulted by any Monarke: that neuer ſtood out a ſiege: &amp; that loſt <hi>Rhenes</hi> within
<hi>8.</hi> daies after he had taken it: ſtop, I wot not by what miſhap, the courſe &amp; enterpriſe of ſo great a king, togither with the reſolution of all <hi>France.</hi> Sir, you haue ouer long borne with the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, raſhneſſe, and outrages of this preſumptious
<hi>Salmonee,</hi> who within your realme playeth the ſoueraigne, holding a Parliament and the eſtates, and threatneth you with the Caſtillian ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: as if you had not at all times chaſed them before you, cauſing them, for the ſhunning of the fight, to croſſe the deepe riuers, and taking
<hi>Amiens</hi> euen before their faces. Now Sir, ye want but this one trauell, for the perfecting of your conqueſt, of the whole inheritance of S.
<hi>Lewis.</hi> All other enterpriſes you ſhall find a thouſand times more eaſie, when you haue the ſtrength of al theſe great Prouinces peaceable at your backe. And co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe, ſo long Sir, as any one place in
<hi>France</hi> may claime it ſelfe your enemie, and foſter rebellion, your eſtate cannot be aſſured. VVhom by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying you, men ſhall bee driuen to depart the realme, and to begge ſome miſerable pention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the treaſurers of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> fewe will delight in ſuch extreame reſolutions: but if they haue a ſhelter at hand, euen in the bowels of
<hi>France,</hi> where ſiluer &amp; all other commodities do abound, it wil yeeld great incourageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſuch as beleeue, that in caſe their enterpriſe ſhuld faile, yet they <pb facs="tcp:22081:307"/>ſhould eſcape by getting into <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and at the laſt, be compriſed in an edict. Sir, you are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the ninth yeare of your raigne: the whole courſe of your life, haue beene no other but tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, garlands, and trophees, brought fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your enemies. It is now time for you to finiſh your great worke, about the reeſtabliſhment of the ſoueraigne power, and the reſtoration of the French Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie. Time requireth that we ſhould now beholde your iuſtice flouriſhing throughout the realme, and the greateſt fortreſſes open their gates to the ſmalleſt of your commaundements. This done Sir, all things ſhall bee poſsible for you. Caſt your eye on euery ſide: conſider the <hi>Chaſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons</hi> Prouinces: euery thing is readie for your conqueſt: they do groue vnder the intollerable burthen of his tyrannie, which worketh them into all maner of deſperatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Yet knowing Sir, that the good of your ſubiects muſt be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theirs: their eye is ſtill vpon
<hi>Brittaine,</hi> as hoping that that buſineſſe once finiſhed, your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie ſhall fauourably looke vpon them: alſo that after thoſe great heroes of antiquitie, you will deliuer the afflicted from the yoke of this cruell <hi>Philip,</hi> the common enemie of all Christ endo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
